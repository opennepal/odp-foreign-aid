Nepals hydro power potential can contribute significantly to economic development, among others enabling the government to provide health, education and other socially inclusive welfare services. Hence, there are clear synergies between energy and the Embassys other priority thematic areas as well as cross-cutting issues as gender equality and social inclusion. Hydro power development is also important in a regional climate context. Despite the recognition that Nepal depends on private investments to utilize its hydro power potential, national and foreign hydro power developers, including Norwegian companies, are not actively backed by the government and public opinion when it comes to the development of specific projects. This is partly due to institutional capacity issues but also to the fact that foreign investments in the hydro power sector is a sensitive issue. On a local level revenue-sharing is a conflict issue.In this context more systematic dialogue and networking with strategic Nepalese energy actors and other donors seems",0,1,0,0,1,,,,0,1,0,0,2011-12-27 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of elected VDC and DDC representatives since 2002 and a weak state have allowed political parties, private sector entrepreneurs and sometimes the administration itself to influence decisions and appropriate resources. SDC proposes to provide a modest budget support to the DDCs in two of its three focus districts: Khotang and Okhaldunga. Coupled with the current SDC presence and positioning in these districts, the budget support should allow SDC to increase its leverage and delivery of development outcomes. The project is also expected to foster a culture of dialogue (and control) among all stakeholders. This should build up experiences and skills that can be used by both the existing local administrations (and the political parties) to prepare for the upcoming transition towards a new federal state, and the new federal unit to possibly build upon.

The target groups for LILI include marginalized and small farmers having farming-land below 0.25 hectare. The achievements of LILI Phase I are encouraging. A total of 64 small irrigation schemes, 3 vegetable collection centres and 29 public-buildings are expected to be completed by end of the Phase I, July 2009. The irrigation has been the main component. LILI monitoring report (March 2009) shows that about 88% LILI-supported farmers have diversified/ intensified cropping practices, and thus increased annual agriculture production by 50%. LILI Phase I has also improved knowledge and capacity of DDCs and local institutions/organizations to build and manage farmers-managed small irrigations. As suggested by the Internal Project Review and a Special Study carried out by SDC Coof, the support to public-buildings will discontinue in Phase II in order to be more focused to the small irrigation systems. Based on good experience made during Phase I, a second phase of four years is proposed.

Through the trainings and practical development work conducted during the programme, the partner s capacities build up and, at the same time, the needs of the Maithili communities are addressed.

In Nepal most cases are caused by falls from heights chiefly from trees (from which poor farmers cut fodder for their stock) and building sites. Road traffic accidents are an increasing cause of SCI. There are currently only three centres in the whole country offering rehabilitation services to people with spinal cord injuries ? two of the three are in Kathmandu. GPHRC provides services to the Western Development Region and through four INF clinics to the Mid-Western Development Region - a total population of around 8.5 million people. At present large proportion of SCI patients present for rehabilitation with pressure sores. These patients require admissions up to 6 months as the pressure sore needs to heal before rehabilitation can commence. Patients admitted without pressure sores can complete the rehabilitation within 6-8 weeks. The project ?Improving rehabilitation services for people with spinal cord injury in western Nepal? will be implemented by International Nepal Fellowship Nepal?s (INF/Nepal) Green Pastures Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre (GPHRC) in collaboration with government and private hospitals in Pokhara Nepal and INF?s Partnership for Rehabilitation (PFR) which supports community-based rehabilitation services in the Western Region of Nepal. This project has three major objectives:1. To reduce the incidence of secondary complications in new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) by providing health education and essential equipment to patients in primary (trauma) care 2. To provide better quality rehabilitation services to SCI clients through building a appropriately designed 12 bed SCI ward block at GPHRC 3. To reduce the incidence of infections and pressure sores in SCI patients after their return home and thereby reduce the rate of re-admission and improve their quality of life,0,0,0,1,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2012-12-31 00:00:00,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,

It is planned in close cooperation with the Tribhuvan University's (TU) Department of Health Physical and Population Education which is the local partner in the project. The pilot project is the first step to aiming at: - increasing the equal access to Physical Education for boys and girls - increasing the gender balance within the teachers who are teaching Physical Education- improving the quality of the PE education- getting the Physical Education into practice and outside the classroom when possible- raising awareness of the importance of Physical Education in the sense of physical health and fitness on the one hand and mental and social health of the students on the other hand- raising awareness of the positive impact that physical activity has on learning- raising awareness that through sports and games all the students can learn skills for life and sometimes find a career or become an athlete- improving the Physical Education curriculum and- improving and formalizing the status of Physical Education as a school subject.In the project ten districts and twenty higher secondary schools (grades 11-12) are chosen from all of the five development regions of Nepal. Districts will be selected considering the Hill and Terai settings. Twenty teachers (female and male) get an intensive training for conducting games and sports for the students. Back in the schools and districts presentation will be given about the key findings to community and the school presonnel. In the schools teachers start programme that includes different sports and games as regular activity and in the form of tournaments. The project schools are provided with necessary games and sports equipment. The students from grades 11 to 12 are the future primary school (grades 1-8) teachers which adds the value of the programme.The field supervisors are nominated to monitor and support the implementation of the programme in the schools. The experiences from the students and teachers will be collected before and after the school year in which the project is implemented and best practices manual 'How to make Physical Education accessible for boys and girls' will be made based on that. In the beginning of the project and after the implementation seminar will be held for all the stakeholders including the Ministry of Education in order to reach the decision-makers.,2,0,0,1,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2012-12-31 00:00:00,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,

Through investments in applied research, the CIFSRF contributes to the development of more productive, sustainable, and gender-sensitive agricultural techniques for women subsistence farmers, with the ultimate goal of making food sources more secure and accessible, and the food produced more nutritious, for poor households - particularly for women and girls, who face the heaviest burden of chronic hunger and malnutrition in developing countries.   One of the objectives of the CIFSRF is to ensure that the results generated by the research funded are used to inform food security policies, programs, and on-the-ground development activities. Partnership is also an important aspect of the CIFSRF. All the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations, such as academic institutions, private sector organizations, civil society organizations, or research institutions. These partnerships harness Canada's expertise in agriculture and nutritional science and combine it with first-hand knowledge and expertise in developing countries, to maximize the benefit for development activities.   Key expected results include: 1) Increased use by research community of Canadian knowledge and resources to address agricultural productivity and nutrition problems in developing countries; 2) Increased global, national, and local knowledge of new, environmentally sustainable, and gender sensitive research applications that increase agricultural productivity and the nutritional value of food in developing countries; and 3) More informed and better developed public policies and CIDA programming related to food security in developing countries.

This project builds on a series of experiences with shifting cultivation in India, Nepal and Bhutan that challenge the prevailing view among policymakers and forestry officials that shifting cultivation is unsustainable and destructive to forests and wildlife. The project is based on the hypothesis that shifting cultivation, if improved and rationalized as an agroforestry system, has high potential for poverty alleviation, food security and biodiversity conservation. Researchers will take a pragmatic approach to dealing with the livelihood issues of the cultivators and the health of the ecosystem, and assess the effects of increasing population pressure and market forces.

Although protracted wars in Aceh, Nepal, Burma and Sri Lanka have ended, the root causes of these conflicts have not yet been addressed. This poses serious threats to the credibility of the States and to the sustainability of peace. Where there are peace agreements and political settlements (Aceh and Nepal), implementation processes have been difficult and accountability remains poor. How can peace processes be made more effective, resilient and transformative?  What role do informal insiders play in fostering legitimacy around political settlements? What degree of inclusion in the political settlement is sufficient to reduce the risk of relapse into violence and can informal networks of influential insiders support transitions from war to peace? This research project examines the influence of informal networks of insiders in Aceh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal to explore whether these insiders can be effective in the pursuit of accountability and in challenging impunity, war crimes and sexual violence after peace settlements. This innovative project will contribute to comparative understanding and help illuminate the constructive potential, if any, of local interlocutors and bridge-builders on how to foster more sustainable and legitimate political settlements.

In Western democracies, the specter of an Orwellian society has been kept at bay by the enforcement of privacy laws. In Asia, home to the greatest number of Internet and mobile users, privacy protection is at best scant. Global prerogatives around security and terrorism, as well as the claimed need for unfettered access to data to improve business opportunities, have been eroding privacy rights in the region. Indeed, privacy and security are almost always presented as mutually exclusive principles that require trade-offs.Recent thinking on these issues has suggested that privacy could be a means of ensuring greater security for government, and even lead to increased business opportunities. Certainly, the interplay between privacy rights, security concerns and business needs to be better understood. This project will therefore investigate privacy issues brought about by an increasingly networked society and its impact on the interaction between citizen, government and the private sector.

Partition-based peace settlements may stop immediate violence, but are likely to produce endemic violence, because the root cause of the grievance - democracy deficit, not ethnicity - remains unresolved.Building on the results of the first phase of the project (103989), researchers will endeavor to bring the voices of the vulnerable into the partition discourse 60 years after the Great Partition of 1947 (India-Pakistan). They will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the integration efforts of the resulting states, the weaknesses inherent in the practice of peacemaking under partition-based peace accords, and ways in which the consequences of partition can be made more democratic, rights enabling, and conducive to peace and security.

Even as the incidence of sexual violence has increased, so has the silence around it. The recent end of violence in Sri Lanka for example, has not resulted in a frank and open discussion about the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. The Bangladesh War Crimes Tribunal of 2009 makes no mention of the question of rape despite the fact that it is widely acknowledged as having happened, and despite women having spoken out about it. This proposal seeks to answer, why, in the midst of detailed and in-depth discussions about virtually every contentious subject in nations and people caught in political conflict, does the issue of sexual violence remain taboo in South Asia? Elsewhere in the world, rape is increasingly being discussed and accepted not only as a weapon of war, but also as a crime against humanity and as an instrument of genocide. The progressive thinking developed in the course of trials such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have brought sexual violence into the mainstream of international jurisprudence which was largely invisible until the 1990s. In South Asia, a comprehensive and critical analysis of existing jurisprudence on sexual violence is a newly emerging area of scholarship and practice and a solid community of practice is still to emerge in this field. There are many dimensions of sexual violence which remain unanswered and unexplored. They range from conceptual clarity on definition of sexual violence, to legal, medical and forensic understanding of evidence gathering, and monitoring of the evidence gathered.  This project aims to build on the advancements of international jurisprudence to ensure that the question of the large scale and calculated attack on women and the systematic violation of their right to bodily integrity and autonomy do not go unnoticed  in South Asia. By uncovering the glaring silences of domestic laws and policies this first of its kind effort will bring together the collective knowledge of South Asian academics, researchers and activists on the difficult subject of sexual violence and impunity and create a body of solid and multi-faceted knowledge about this important subject in order to show the way towards beginning a meaningful, nuanced and practical dialogue on peace and justice. The project will not stop at gaining knowledge but also aims to build a community of new, young and committed researchers who will bring fresh insights to bear on their work. The findings will be disseminated through books and other media, and will be used to further advocacy and lobbying work with States and governments so that the issue of sexual violence and impunity is given the attent",2,0,0,2,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2012-08-24 00:00:00,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,

Malnutrition's most devastating impact is on foetal growth, and during the first two years of a child's life. Malnutrition accounts for up to 40% of child deaths each year. Despite healthy levels of economic growth, many of South Asia's countries have persistent and unacceptable levels of malnutrition with complex causality. South Asia has both the highest rates and the largest numbers of malnutrition in the world. Gender inequality and social exclusion are at the heart of the malnutrition problem in South Asia. About 23% (336 million) of the population in South Asia are routinely hungry, without access to enough calories, every day. This is greatly undermining human development and limiting South Asia's productivity with potential GDP loss estimates up to 3%.

MEDEP IV s outcome therefore will not be limited to just creating new and resilient entrepreneurs; by transitioning Micro Enterprise Development (MED) to GoN management and strengthening government systems, its main objective will be to endow Nepal with a sustainable institutional setup for the delivery and support of micro-entrepreneurship extending beyond the life of MEDEP.

This National Strategic Application grant aims to build on the gains made during the last 13 year of DOTS implementation and ensure the quality assured comprehensive implementation of the Stop TB Strategy. The goal of the Program is to reduce the mortality, morbidity and transmission of TB until it is no longer a public health problem in Nepal. The Program is targeting districts with low TB case detection rates; TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients and their close contacts; patients suffering from respiratory illnesses; and public health care providers.
