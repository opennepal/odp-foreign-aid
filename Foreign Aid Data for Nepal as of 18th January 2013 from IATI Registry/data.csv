The project aims to increase the capacity of a local partner to do holistic development work in local communities. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world_ where majority of the people live in rural areas. Fidaâs partner in Nepal is the Assemblies of God church (AOG). The project provides training and awareness-raising for the partner on a great variety of issues related to development work. Fida and AOG work together in the local communities and through this hands-on development work the partner acquires practical skills. The project focuses on three major components: Literacy_ Community Health Education (CHE) and HIV/AIDS. As AOGâs skills and knowledge grow_ the partner will become increasingly capable of doing effective community development work of its own. This will contribute to the increasing impact of the partnerâs work at community level.,http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=FI-3-2007-236-5461,USD,306643,224157,0,0,0,0,0,2007-03-15,,,,2010-12-31,,,,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,,2,Implementation,1,,,,,Strengthening civil society,,15150,,Participatory Development,,2,3,,,,,,,,110,,10,,4,,,,2011-08-17T00:00:00,

The programme seeks to increase a local partnerâs capacity to respond to the needs of the Maithili minority in Southern Nepal. The 2.5 million Maithili of Southern Nepal make up the countryâs largest ethnic minority. Formerly known for their rich culture and traditions_ the Maithili now live in poverty and have almost lost their unique identity. To address the needs of the Maithili_ Fida partners with a local NGO called Relative Nepal_ which belongs to the Assemblies of God Nepal (AGN) church.

British Red Cross,GB-CC-220949-005,Earthquake Preparedness for Safer Communities - Nepal,"The programme contributes to the Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium (NRRC) an initiative which aims to support the Government of Nepal in developing a long term Disaster Risk Reduction Action Plan. The programme is centred around community-level multi-hazard risk reduction interventions targeted at 66 communities and a mass communication campaign to raise the awareness of the entire population of Kathmandu Valley about the risks they face and risk reduction actions they can take to protect themselves and their families. It also seeks to improve the NRCS’s capacity to respond to disasters. 

Key activities:
•	Decrease risks encountered by 66 vulnerable communities through community based strategies to enhance awareness, organisational preparedness and resilience.
•	Develop an earthquake preparedness mass communication campaign targeting 2 to 4 million people. 
•	Strengthen capacity of NCRS to respond to a major disaster emergency within the national disaster management system.

Global targets for TB control have been achieved by the Program consistently over the past several years and Nepal has achieved the Millennium Development Goal of reducing the prevalence of TB by 50 per cent. This National Strategic Application grant aims to build on the gains made during the last 13 year of DOTS implementation and ensure the quality assured comprehensive implementation of the Stop TB Strategy.  The goal of the Program is to reduce the mortality, morbidity and transmission of TB until it is no longer a public health problem in Nepal. The Program is targeting districts with low TB case detection rates; TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients and their close contacts; patients suffering from respiratory illnesses; and public health care providers. This Program consolidates the Round 7 and Round 4 TB grants and the approved National Strategy Application.

United Nations Development Programme,41114-OUTPUT-00060717,Access to Financial Services,"EAFS _ Introduction

Enhancing Access to Financial Services (EAFS) project implemented by the central bank of Nepal (i.e.NRB) with the help of UNDP and UNCDF is the first this kind of project to provide technical assistance to the MFIs in Nepal. The project objective is to expand microfinance services to 330,000 additional new clients and establish linkages between 10,000 SCGs with MFIs duration 2008-2012.
The intervention logic is that improvements in the enabling environment for inclusive finance, supported by catalytic investments in Financial Service Providers (FSPs) and supporting industry infrastructure, will strengthen selected FSPs, thus improving their ability to provide appropriate products and services to previously unbanked and marginalized populations. 

The project has adopted main two strategies for outreach expansion particularly in remote areas of Nepal by forging partnership with 10 selected prominent MFIs of country as Strategic Partners and  8 MFIs for the innovations proposed to increase outreach as Innovative Partners . 18 FSPs have signed grant agreements (called performance-based agreements, or PBAs). 
The 18 partners have  expanded 97 new branches with the support of the project expanding additional 15  unreached districts  out of total  63 total working districts by all MFIs during 2010 and 2011. They have achieved 214,900 additional new clients by mid January 2012 as of Mid January 2012.  
Innovations include new innovative ideas like real time monitoring, biometry adoption, categorization of   client, agent banking etc.

During the project period, the project also supported to change the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and behavior patterns of the concerned in the partner organization(s) to some extent.  Basically, EAFS Project  had organized two events of interactive meeting among FSPs and other development agencies with an objective to look at potential to develop linkages between the community groups/SCGs and the MFIs. These kinds of events had helped the stakeholders mainly the development partner agencies to reflect and realize the importance and possibility of linkages between the saving and credit groups (SCGs) with the MFIs. To date cumulative No. of 2,748, have been reported  to have linked with MFIs  benefiting  62,537 clients as of  January 2012.

Other achievements  include: 
•	Rating of 10 partner MFIs by international rating agency ( i.e. M-Cril) completed.
•	On-site and off-site technical assistance (TA) through field visit, facilitation and training
•	Quarterly review workshops organized among the partner FSPs has given a good platform for sharing experiences/lesson 
•	Oriented he FSPS on SCG linkage model,  interactive workshops with MFIs and other development partners organized, 
•	Developed and shared SCGs rating tools with partner MFIs, 
•	Provided exposure visit to MFIs on SHG linkage model; 
•	Provided Technical Assistance in organizing Market research and product development Training to the partner FSPS
•	provided training on MIX market reporting system and arrange to send information to MIX market through Central of Micro-finance.  All Partner updates at Mix market platform : http://www.mixmarket.org/mfi/country/Nepal 
•	regular monitoring and reporting system put in place  quarterly reporting, quarterly review and sharing among the partner MFIs  including field level monitoring are done regularly.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=41114-OUTPUT-00060717,USD,0,0,0,425140,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,http://www.undp.org.np/,,,4,Multilateral outflows,,,,STD control including HIV/AIDS,DAC,13040,,,,,,,,,registry.np@undp.org,,C01,Project Type Interventions,110,Grant,10,ODA,5,Untied,41114-PROJECT-00049650,2,2013-01-10T09:45:00,

This project aims to prepare the NAPA based on a country-driven consultative process.  The vulnerability and impacts of climate change on socio-economic conditions and ecosystems, including biodiversity and natural resources, will be assessed. Existing coping strategies and indigenous knowledge of disaster-affected people will be identified, and existing national mechanisms, approaches and capacities will be analysed. Key climate change adaptation priorities will be identified, including capacity development needs at the individual and institutional levels. 

The NAPA formulation process will provide a launching pad for the development of a multi-stakeholder Framework on Climate Change Action in Nepal. Analyzing various NAPA processes in other LDCs, the government of Nepal has mobilized substantive co-financing from bilateral donors to ensure that the NAPA-related stakeholder processes in Nepal can be institutionalized and receives dedicated Knowledge Management and Learning support even after a NAPA document has been submitted to the UNFCCC. In complementing the formulation of the NAPA with dedicated capacity development and technical support activities, Nepal will be in a position to not only submit a NAPA document at the end of the projects duration, but also have the institutional capacities in place to propose a cross-sectoral Climate Change Programme for harmonized donor support which addresses critical information, policy and capacity gaps in potentially vulnerable sectors.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=41114-OUTPUT-00060284,USD,0,0,0,152146,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,http://www.undp.org.np/,,,4,Multilateral outflows,,,,Sectors Not Specified,DAC,99810,,,,,,,,,registry.np@undp.org,,C01,Project Type Interventions,110,Grant,10,ODA,5,Untied,41114-PROJECT-00049433,2,2013-01-10T09:45:00,

United Nations Development Programme,41114-OUTPUT-00041382,Western Terai Landscap Complex,"The project is designed to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the western part of Nepal's Terai Arc Landscape by establishing effective management systems and building capacity for the conservation and sustainable use of the Western Terai landscape complex (WTLC).  The project strategy is based on the premise that the long-term viability of globally significant biodiversity hinges on the ability to manage an overall system of habitats in a wide ecological landscape that goes beyond the confines of protected areas.  Protected areas remain critical elements in biodiversity management.  Therefore, project interventions will strengthen fledgling protected area management systems towards scientific and participatory approaches to improve conservation efforts and effectively address root causes of threats to biodiversity conservation.  

The project's landscape approach will reorient Nepal's policy and legal framework and institutional arrangements towards integrated ecosystem management to achieve the multiple objectives of conservation, sustainable natural resource management, and poverty alleviation.  Ultimately, the project aims to develop replicable landscape-level management models to safeguard the biological wealth and vital ecological functions in Nepal.

With reference to the GEF's newly established Strategic Priorities, the project design is consistent with the objective of Strategic Priority II, i.e. Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Production landscapes and Sectors.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=41114-OUTPUT-00041382,USD,0,0,0,844816,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,http://www.undp.org.np/,,,4,Multilateral outflows,,,,Sectors Not Specified,DAC,99810,,,,,,,,,registry.np@undp.org,,C01,Project Type Interventions,110,Grant,10,ODA,5,Untied,41114-PROJECT-00037768,2,2013-01-10T09:45:00,

United Nations Office for Project Services,41AAA-00043831,"Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme, 3rd Operational Phase","Launched in 1992, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP) is rooted in the belief that global environmental problems can be best addressed if local people are involved and direct community benefits and ownership are generated. In fourteen years of operation, SGP has worked with thousands of community –based organizations (CBOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in now 84 countries in five world regions: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Arab States, Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States and Latin America/ Caribbean. In partnership with these local organizations, SGP has demonstrated that even with small amounts of funding (SGO grants are less than $50,000), local communities can undertake activities that will make a significant difference in their lives and environments and contribute to global environmental benefits at the same time. Since its inception, SGP has operated in decentralized, democratic, transparent, and country-driven manner, through National Coordinators (NC) and National Steering Committees (NSC). SGP grant-making, guided by Country Programme Strategies (CPS) developed on the basis of a global Strategic Framework in tandem with national environmental priorities, has funded close to 5,000 projects worldwide. The programme has paid especial attention attention to local and indigenous communities and gender concerns, and aimed for the replication and sustainability of its initiatives. As such, the programme has influenced national policies and donor agendas by increasing awareness of global environmental issues and communicating lessons learned, including best practices from community-based experiences. As SGP matured during the Second Operational Phase (1999-2005), the GEF Council has authorized SGP to expand at an accelerated pace, increasing the number of new countries incorporated annually from five to ten, and has enjoined SGP to give priority to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in this further expansion. Since the launch of SGP’s Third Operational Phase in 2005, the questions of project sustainability and impact have become increasingly significant and SGP, as part of the wider GEF, has been called upon to address more effectively the matter of project and programme impacts and global benefits. This will entail refocusing SGP monitoring and evaluation processes and communications strategies towards impact and assessment and knowledge management. In the Third Operational Phase, SGP will intensify its efforts to facilitate increased access of the same local stakeholders to GEF resources to undertake activities in the GEF focal areas, by supporting outreach, capacity building, and building networking among grantees, This will be especially critical as the programme expands to include more LDCs and SIDS. The project continues with the following six outcomes: Global reach of SGP increased, especially to address global environmental problems in vulnerable countries; Country programmes implementing well designed project portfolios that incorporate new GEF Ops, SPs and focal areas; Existing country programmes maintained and strengthened; Local and global benefits of SGP demonstrated and applied; SGP-funded project sustainability enhanced; SGP potential as a GEF corporate programme more fully realized. The GEF SGP is implemented by UNDP on behalf of the three implementing agencies of the GEF – UNDP, World Bank and UNEP – and executed by UNOPS. SGP will continue to operate in a highly decentralized and country-driven manner through an NC and NSC in each participating country with support from the UNDP Country Office and in some countries, National Host Institution (NHI) or host NGO. The UNDP-Central Programme Management Team (CPMT) and UNOPS will provide as before, coordination, global guidance, support and supervision. The UNDP GEF Unit at UNDP Headquarters in New York manages all of its GEF activities, including SGP. The UNDP GEF Executive Coordinator and his/her Deputy are accountable, both to UNDP and to the GEF Secretariat and Council, for all UNDP GEF activities, including SGP. UNOPS, flowing agreed procedures, policy and strategy with UNDP-CPMT will continue to be responsible programme management (in financial and administrative areas) and execution support services in the following areas: personnel recruitment and contract administration for project staff and consultants; subcontracts for host institutions; monitoring, supervision and authorization and monitoring of expenditures; training and guidance on the above to country-level staff; and support for initiation of the programme in new countries.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=41AAA-00043831,USD,106747664,0,0,1607780,0,0,0,,,2005-02-03,,,,2012-12-31,,,,,United Nations Office for Project Services,NP,Nepal,,679,"South Asia, regional",,https://data.unops.org/index.htm#SegmentCode=ORG&FocusCode=DATA_PROJECTS&EntityCode=PROJECT_ID&EntityValue=00043831,2,Implementation,2,Multilateral,,,,Environmental policy and administrative management,DAC,41010,100,,,,,United Nations Office for Project Services,Cillian Domhnall OCATHAIL,4535467600,info@unops.org,"UNOPS HQ, PO Box 2695, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",C01,Project-type interventions,110,Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,20,OOF,5,Untied,,,2013-01-15T08:09:57.980,
United Nations Office for Project Services,41AAA-00056189,Support to Improvised Explosive Device Disposal/Explosive Ordinance Disposal operations in Nepal,"The project seeks to contribute to the safe storage and destruction of all explosive remnants of war (ERW) stored at cantonment and satellite sites by the provision of technical expertise to advise, assist and support the Maoist Army Combatants and the Nepalese Army. This will greatly enhance the safety of UN Staff and other persons current residing in and around the main cantonment sites and their associated satellite sites and their associated satellite sites. Although national TED expertise and capacity exists within the Nepalese Army (NA), at this stage of the Peace process it is unacceptable for the Maoist Army Combatants to agree to NA presence and assistance within their cantonments. Consequently, UNMIN will have to assist in mitigating the risks through provision of technical TED expertise within the Maoist Army Combatants cantonments. In order to achieve the safe destruction of all ERW in the seven cantonment sites and their associated satellite sites, a British commercial company, Armor Group (competitively selected) was contracted by UNOPS to provide technical expertise. UNOPS is the agency directly involved in the execution of the project. UNOPS is represented by the UN Mine Action Unit (UNOPS staff) based in Kathmandu. The Unit is part of the UNOPS executed UNMAS project “Mine Action Support to the UN Mission in Nepal” funded through the UN Assessed budget.

United Nations Office for Project Services,41AAA-00057298,"Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme, 4th Operational Phase","The Small Grants Programme, through hundreds of demand-driven community-based projects implemented by NGOs and CBOs, supports the achievement of GEF Focal Area Strategies and their indicators. Though pre-project quantification is not possible within a demand driven approach, SGP projects will in particular contribute to: (a) strengthening the Protected Areas (PA) systems of its participating countries in terrestrial as well as marine/freshwater protected areas by catalyzing community-indigenous initiatives that promote the participation and capacity building of local community and indigenous groups in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of efforts to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; mainstreaming biodiversity in production Iandscapes /seascapes by demonstrating improved livelihoods based on sustainable use and harvest; generation, dissemination and uptake of good practices through increased innovation in project design and implementation; (b) promotion of sustainable mobility through non-motorized transport; electricity production from rural renewable energy installations; support growth of interest in Iow-GHG emitting electricity generating technologies; piloting and demonstration of operational approaches to community-based adaptation; (C) improving the performance and sustainability of transboundary institutions (e.g. support for community-based projects to complement PEMSEA’s national and regional initiatives); support IW programme area- foundational/capacity building through demonstration projects that engage local stakeholders on transboundary concerns; support the adoption of local/national reforms by SIDS through water- related demos; (d) dissemination of information on best practices regarding POPs management; promotion of partnerships in demonstration of innovative technologies and practices in POPs reduction; (e) implementation of NGO-led or community-based Sustainable Land Management (SLM) initiatives that apply innovative and best practices in demonstration areas; development of innovative knowledge products that will fill identified knowledge gaps in the Land Degradation (LD) focal area; implementation of interventions that promote cross focal area synergies and integrated ecosystem approaches to SLM; (f) support to enabling activities and cross-cutting capacity building by strengthening civil society participation.The GEF SGP is implemented byUNDP on behalf of the three implementing agencies of the GEF — UNDP, World Bank, and UNEP — and executed by UNOPS. SGP will continue to operate in a highly decentralized and country-driven manner through a National Coordinator (NC) and National Steering Committee (NSC) in each participating country, with support from the UNDP Country Office and in some countries, a National Host Institution (NH I) or host NGO. The UNDP-CPMT and UNOPS will provide, as before, global guidance, coordination, support, and supervision. The UNDP GEF Unit at UNDP Headquarters in New York manages all of its GEF activities, including SGP. The UNDP GEF Executive Coordinator and his/her Deputy are accountable, both to UNDP and to the GEF Secretariat and Council, for all UNDP GEE activities, including SGP. The UNDP Central Programme Management Team (CPMT), located within the UNDP/GEF Unit, is composed of the Global Manager, Deputy Global Manager (Programme), Deputy Global Manager (Operations), Climate Change Programme Officer, Biodiversity Programme Officer, Land Degradation/International Waters/POPs Programme Officer, Knowledge Facilitator, Programme Associate, and Administrative Assistant. The CPMT is responsible for the overall programme, provides operational guidance and support to the country programmes, including identification and establishment of the SGP in new countries, and reports to the GEF Secretariat and Council. Through a global M&E framework and communications strategy, it monitors country programmes and coordinates the documentation and dissemination of lessons learned from the programme’s community-based experiences. UNOPS following agreed procedures, policy and strategy with the CPMT will continue to be responsible for providing programme management (in financial and administrative areas) and execution support services in the following areas: (1 ) personnel recruitment and contract administration for project staff and consultants; (2) subcontracts for host institutions; (3) monitoring, supervision and authorization of country programme grant allocations and disbursements; (4) budget administration, including authorization and monitoring of expenditures; (5) training and guidance on the above to country-level project staff; and (6) support for initiation of the programme in new countries. The UNDP Country Office (CO) following SGP Operational Guidelines will continue to participate in providing overall management support to operations in each of the SGP country programmes. The UN Resident Representative (or Res. Coordinator) in each Country Office assigns a staff member to serve as the SGP focal point, and the RRIRC or the focal point as his/her delegate participates in the NSC. Each UNDP CO also contributes to monitoring programme activities — usually through broad oversight by the designated focal point as part of NSC responsibilities; facilitates interaction with the host government; and develops links with other in a country financial and technical resources. The CO is also responsible for providing financial and administrative services to the programme, and the Resident Representative signs the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with NGO/CBO grantees, on behalf of UNOPS. The Country Office administers the disbursement of grant payments in accordance with the terms of the MOA and as authorized by UNOPS. It also plays a fundamental role in launching a new SGP programme and in the appointment of National Steering Committee (NSC) members once ratified by the CPMT. As the programme has evolved, the UNDP Country Office is also expected to help develop the links between SGP and the other GEE Implementing Agencies and Executing Agencies at country level. In some countries, the SGP is located in a National Host Institution (‘IHI), normally a national non- governmental organization (NGO) or national environment fund. Programme hosting arrangements are normally considered during a new country appraisal mission. UNOPS administers a subcontract for professional services with the host NGO that outlines the technical support and administrative services to be provided and an operating budget. The sub-contract contains rules of collaboration with the host organization as defined in the offer or terms of reference, both of which are integral parts of the subcontract. This contract is supervised by UNOPS. All country programmes, whether based in the UNDP or in a host NGO, equally respond to the SGP Strategic Framework, Operational Guidelines, and other global programme guidance. The following NGOs have been identified as National Host Institutions (NHI) for the 4th Phase - some of which more recently - for the respective countries: Brazil - Instituto Sociedade, PopuIao E Natureza (ISPN), Cook Islands - CIANGO, Dominca - Dominica Saves the Children Fund (hosts SGP COMPACT), Egypt - Arab Office for Youth and Environment (AOYE), India - Cents for Environmental Education (CEE), Indonesia - Yayasan bina Usha Lingkungan (YBUL), Jordan - Jordan Royal Ecological Diving Society (JREDS), Namibia - Namibia Nature Foundation, Tunisia - L'Audit Environnemental (AE), Micronesia - Mcronesia Conservation Trust (MCT), Palau - Palau Conservation Society (PCS), Tonag - Civil Society Forum for Tonga (CSFT), Tuvalu - Tuvalu Association of NGOs (TANGO), Vanuatu - Vanuatu Association of NGOs (VANGO), Zambia - Keepers Zambia Foundation.The National Steering Committee (NSC) is composed of voluntary members from NGOs, academic and scientific institutions, other civil society organizations, the UNDP Country Office, government, and donors in cases of large scale co-financing, with a majority of members coming from the non-governmental sector It provides overall guidance and direction to the country programme, and contributes to developing and implementing strategies for country programme sustainability. The National Coordinator (NC) has the lead responsibility for managing country programme implementation. The NC reports to the CPMT and UNOPS as required. The budget comprises of four main components: A. Grants B. Programme mobilization, strategic guidance and M&E C. Programme management (with two subcomponents) 1. Country-level 2. Global programme-level (HQ) D. Administrative costs /UNOPS Management Fee.

The project also includes provision of fertilizer for the project area. It is expected that the project will reach nearly 50% of the 147,000 farm families in the project area. Irrigation works benefitting at least 10,000 farm families and trails and bridges benefitting all the population in these districts will also be upgraded.

The project adopts a community driven development approach to the delivery of rural water supply and sanitation services. The communities are assisted by support organizations, primarily Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to plan, design and implement their water and sanitation facilities. The request for additional financing is to address: (i) cost overruns; and (ii) scale up the number of water supply and sanitation services in rural areas so as to maximize positive development impacts in underserved remote areas. Additional Financing is viewed as the best option mainly because it: (a) is a quick and available means of funding the cost overruns to allow the Board to complete its ongoing schemes and deliver water supply and sanitation services to the rural communities where it has already begun work; (b) allows the Board to continue its good governance practices that apply streamlined objective eligibility criteria to select schemes and support organizations in a transparent manner to deliver water supply and sanitation services, and to do away with ad hoc decisions. Without funding, there is a risk that these good practices will be discontinued and the task of rebuilding them will not be easy. The additional financing will help the Board to strengthen its initiatives to set up a social audit committee and community score card system throughout the project areas.

The PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the investment climate. The PRSC program also supports Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving service delivery by assisting the government in developing annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging civil service diversity. It also supports the government's strategy to improve governance by improving the effectiveness of the civil service, strengthening anti-corruption and accountability institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies, and, improving financial management and procurement practices. The improvements in governance that are supported by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable, efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a more favorable investment climate, and lead to better service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in case reforms are reversed, or materially changed.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=44000-P074685,USD,0,0,0,0,0,0,-622307,,,2003-11-18,2003-11-18,2004-11-01,2004-11-01,,,International Development Association,International Development Association,,,NP,NEPAL,100,,,,http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P074685?lang=en,3,Completion,2,Multilateral,,,,"Primary education; Health policy and administrative management; Water supply - large systems ; Basic drinking water supply; Public sector policy and administrative management; Public finance management; Financial policy and administrative management; Formal sector financial intermediaries; General public administration sector; Health; Primary education; Water supply; Banking; Public expenditure, financial management and procurement; Regulation and competition policy; Decentralization; Administrative and civil service reform; Participation and civic engagement",DAC; DAC; DAC; DAC; DAC; DAC; DAC; DAC; WBSector; WBSector; WBSector; WBSector; WBSector; WBTheme; WBTheme; WBTheme; WBTheme; WBTheme,11220; 12110; 14021; 14031; 15110; 15111; 24010; 24030; BZ; JA; EP; WC; FA; 0027; 0040; 0026; 0025; 0057,15; 15; 8; 8; 11; 29; 7; 7; 40; 15; 15; 15; 15; 29; 29; 14; 14; 14,,,,,The World Bank,,+1-202-473-1000,pic@worldbank.org,"The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",C01,Project-type interventions,,,,,5,Untied,,,2012-06-21 09:06:08,

World Bank Group,44000-P083923,NP: Rural Access Improve. & Decentraliza,"This project paper provides an additional grant to Nepal Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (RAIDP). The additional finance will fill a financing gap that has occurred due to both a change in technical specification (moving from gravel to otta seal, all-season roads) and cost increases from input price rises over the course of project implementation. The modification in specification resulted in a change in the average price per km of US$3,688 while the price of inputs more than doubled between 2005 - 2007 with reinforcement bars and cement increasing by an average of 130 percent. Since the peak, prices have dropped by about 25 percent but remain high. On average, these increases led to a 36 percent cost increase per km during project implementation. On a cost-effectiveness basis the project remained justified since average per capita expenditure remained well under US$1006 and the revised economic rate of return (ERR) is 29 percent. The project originally aimed to provide 1.2 million beneficiaries with access to all season roads. Due to the cost overruns only about 900,000 people would be able to benefit from project activities in the 20 project districts, if the financing gap is not filled.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=44000-P083923,USD,0,5816011,0,0,0,0,0,,,2005-06-21,2005-06-21,2013-12-31,2013-12-31,,,International Development Association,International Development Association,,DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL ROADS,NP,NEPAL,100,,,,http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P083923?lang=en,2,Implementation,2,Multilateral,,,,Road transport; Rural development; Roads and highways; Rural services and infrastructure; Decentralization; Other social development,DAC; DAC; WBSector; WBTheme; WBTheme; WBTheme,21020; 43040; TA; 0078; 0026; 0062,83; 17; 100; 50; 25; 25,,,,,The World Bank,,+1-202-473-1000,pic@worldbank.org,"The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",C01,Project-type interventions,,,,,5,Untied,44000-P107853,2,2012-06-21 09:06:08,
World Bank Group,44000-P084219,NP: Fin Sector Restructuring (Phase II),"The main objective of the project is to support the on-going efforts to develop a healthier financial sector in Nepal which intermediates funds more efficiently and effectively to the benefit of all segments of society and in a manner which supports private sector development, increased investment, and faster growth. The project has the following four components: Component 1) Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS). The largest component is designed to support the VRS in Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) in an effort to reduce their costs and ultimately assist in making them more saleable/privatizable institutions. Component 2) Hiring of Sales Advisors. The hiring of the Sales (Privatization) Advisors will not happen until a year or so into the project when the banks are in a better financial condition and are therefore more viable privatization candidates. These Advisors will undertake proper due diligence, prepare a prospectus for the banks, and then undertake a road show to bring them to the point of sale to fit and proper private sector buyers as rapidly as possible. Component 3) Phase II: On-going Nepal Rastra Bank Re-engineering. The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has commenced a process of re-engineering within the central bank. However, reform, revitalization, and professionalization are complicated, long-term tasks. Greatly enhancing the capacity of NRB to oversee a prudently operated banking system is a prime objective of the series of reforms being undertaken within the sector. Whereas the Phase I reforms in banking supervision have focused on developing an appropriate off-site reporting system and a minimalist amount of on-site bank supervisory assistance, the Phase I1 reforms will assist in augmenting the on-site supervisory capacities to oversee the commercial banks. Component 4) Management Team Support. It is agreed, that the two banks may not be privatized by the time that the current three year term of the existing Management Teams expire (two years with a possible one-year extension). It is equally recognized that the banks should not revert to old management practices. It is therefore necessary to include funding for a contingency to cover the costs of continuing management team support up until the point of privatization.",http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/explorer/activity/?activity=44000-P084219,USD,0,0,0,0,0,0,-460732,,,2004-03-09,2004-03-09,2009-09-30,2009-09-30,,,International Development Association,International Development Association,,NEPAL RASTRA BANK (THE CENTRAL BANK OF NEPAL),NP,NEPAL,100,,,,http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P084219?lang=en,3,Completion,2,Multilateral,,,,Financial policy and administrative management; Formal sector financial intermediaries; Banking; State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization; International financial standards and systems,DAC; DAC; WBSector; WBTheme; WBTheme,24010; 24030; FA; 0043; 0042,50; 50; 100; 67; 33,,,,,The World Bank,,+1-202-473-1000,pic@worldbank.org,"The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",C01,Project-type interventions,,,,,5,Untied,,,2012-06-21 09:06:08,
