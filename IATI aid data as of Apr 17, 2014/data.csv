through the implementation of pilot routes provided with electric vehicles; (ii) traffic management
works and measures that will enable heritage routes in the city center to be pedestrianized and
improve general walkability (general walking conditions); and (iii) improvement of air quality
monitoring. The project aims to integrate these components holistically. The environment for
development work has greatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The
experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has shown that active community
participation can insulate development work from a country's wider challenges and thus bring
about effective service delivery. Consultations were undertaken with various stakeholders,
including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), relevant central government ministries and
departments, public transport operators, and residents associations. The project design and

These factors include the need for aligning one activity with related activities under another project, longer than anticipated time in finalization of technical solution for another activity, delays in securing necessary statutory approvals for some activities, and implementation period of some activities extending beyond the project closing date due to delayed start. The restructuring seeks to drop activities that have not been procured, while extending the closing date to allow for the completion of activities critical to the development of power sector in Nepal, and for which in the most part, the contractors are already mobilized, supplies are on the ground and work is ongoing.

The additional credit will finance costs associated with scaled-up activities under the project. The changes and additional financing activities will remain consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The main reasons for reduced financing were that the project was introducing new concepts and reengaging financially in the agriculture sector and it was felt that a smaller initial investment would be more prudent. The changes to the project are: a) extension of the closing date of the original project; b) revised project development objective to remove the restriction on project districts and scale up the scope of the project; and c) revised targets of outcome indicators to reflect scaling up of investments. This will require an amendment to the financing agreement for the current project. Extension of the closing date is being sought to ensure enough time for the scaled up programs to be completed and results to be documented.,2,2005-03-02,2018-06-30,2005-03-02,2018-06-30,,,,International Development Association,44002,,International Development Association,44002,,MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND COOPERATIVES,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,;;;;;33130;32161;31191;31110,;;;;;Regional trade agreements (RTAs);Agro-industries;Agricultural services;Agricultural policy and administrative management,10;90;16;28;56;5;41;35;19,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,40000000,5745544,0,0,0,0,0

GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVIâs injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets.

In Nepal most cases are caused by falls from heights chiefly from trees (from which poor farmers cut fodder for their stock) and building sites. Road traffic accidents are an increasing cause of SCI. There are currently only three centres in the whole country offering rehabilitation services to people with spinal cord injuries ? two of the three are in Kathmandu. GPHRC provides services to the Western Development Region and through four INF clinics to the Mid-Western Development Region - a total population of around 8.5 million people. At present large proportion of SCI patients present for rehabilitation with pressure sores. These patients require admissions up to 6 months as the pressure sore needs to heal before rehabilitation can commence. Patients admitted without pressure sores can complete the rehabilitation within 6-8 weeks. The project ?Improving rehabilitation services for people with spinal cord injury in western Nepal? will be implemented by International Nepal Fellowship Nepal?s (INF/Nepal) Green Pastures Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre (GPHRC) in collaboration with government and private hospitals in Pokhara Nepal and INF?s Partnership for Rehabilitation (PFR) which supports community-based rehabilitation services in the Western Region of Nepal. This project has three major objectives:1. To reduce the incidence of secondary complications in new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) by providing health education and essential equipment to patients in primary (trauma) care 2. To provide better quality rehabilitation services to SCI clients through building a appropriately designed 12 bed SCI ward block at GPHRC 3.

The ESP adopted a program cluster approach to phase ADB assistance. Three subprograms were envisioned in accordance with the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 onward. The ESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the Nepal EFA program (2004-2009) for basic and primary education (grades 1-5) with a program loan for $30 million from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of $2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders' capacity in policy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core document. The ESP subprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation and transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1-8 in a few districts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness.
The ESP subprogram III is proposed to support the Government in the implementation of the SSR program from 2009 onward. Subprogram III will cover the period from FY2010 to FY2012, during which the Government will focus on the implementation of basic education restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT).

The project has the following four components: Component 1) Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS). The largest component is designed to support the VRS in Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) in an effort to reduce their costs and ultimately assist in making them more saleable/privatizable institutions. Component 2) Hiring of Sales Advisors. The hiring of the Sales (Privatization) Advisors will not happen until a year or so into the project when the banks are in a better financial condition and are therefore more viable privatization candidates. These Advisors will undertake proper due diligence, prepare a prospectus for the banks, and then undertake a road show to bring them to the point of sale to ""fit and proper"" private sector buyers as rapidly as possible. Component 3) Phase II: On-going Nepal Rastra Bank Re-engineering. The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has commenced a process of re-engineering within the central bank. However, reform, revitalization, and professionalization are complicated, long-term tasks. Greatly enhancing the capacity of NRB to oversee a prudently operated banking system is a prime objective of the series of reforms being undertaken within the sector. Whereas the Phase I reforms in banking supervision have focused on developing an appropriate off-site reporting system and a minimalist amount of on-site bank supervisory assistance, the Phase I1 reforms will assist in augmenting the on-site supervisory capacities to oversee the commercial banks. Component 4) Management Team Support. It is agreed, that the two banks may not be privatized by the time that the current three year term of the existing Management Teams expire (two years with a possible one-year extension). It is equally recognized that the banks should not revert to old management practices. It is therefore necessary to include funding for a contingency to cover the costs of continuing management team support up until the point of privatization.",3,2003-12-31,2009-09-30,2003-12-31,2009-09-30,,,,International Development Association,44002,,International Development Association,44002,,NEPAL RASTRA BANK (THE CENTRAL BANK OF NEPAL),,,NP,Nepal,,,,,;;;24030;24010,;;;Formal sector financial intermediaries;Financial policy and administrative management,33;67;100;50;50,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,0,0,0,0,-1121765,0,0

The PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the investment climate. The PRSC program also supports Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving service delivery by assisting the government in developing annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging civil service diversity. It also supports the government's strategy to improve governance by improving the effectiveness of the civil service, strengthening anti-corruption and accountability institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies, and, improving financial management and procurement practices. The improvements in governance that are supported by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable, efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a more favorable investment climate, and lead to better service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in case reforms are reversed, or materially changed.",3,2003-09-15,2004-11-01,2003-09-15,2004-11-01,,,,International Development Association,44002,,International Development Association,44002,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;24030;24010;;15110;;;12110;11220,;;;;;;;;;;Formal sector financial intermediaries;Financial policy and administrative management;;Economic and development policy/planning;;;Health policy and administrative management;Primary education,14;14;14;29;29;15;15;15;15;40;7;7;29;11;8;8;15;15,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,0,0,0,0,-1501690,0,0

The project basically aims to strengthen the rule of law by supporting firstly the ?administration of justice sector? with the Supreme Court playing a lead role through JSCC Secretariat and its network. Secondly through reforms in ?socio-legal? aspect of the rule of law and ?access to justice sector? the project envisages to implement protective laws by developing a ?national legal aid scheme? .?Access to justice? with focus on vulnerable groups needs special attention and has been positively designed to implement through ?legal aid centers? and ?legal aid service providers?. Affirmative programs with specified figures of the beneficiaries on the other hand have been proposed to increase the number of hitherto deprived groups build their competency through educational scholarship internship and apprenticeship. Suggested legislative reforms to reduce discriminatory treatments and opportunities would have both symbolic value as well as impelling factor to gear up the project focus towards the needy groups.

Nepal is still emerging from a 10-year armed conflict that ended in 2006 and is currently passing through a momentous and prolonged political transition which is still in a fragile and incomplete state. This transition entails two interrelated processes: promulgation of a new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. The Constitution is expected to lead to a major restructuring of Nepal into a federal state while the completion of the peace process is expected to resolve the integration/rehabilitation of former Maoist combatants. Nepal's peace process is progressing with the closure of Maoist cantonments and political parties attempting to resolve all contentious outstanding constitutional issues. These issues include state restructuring, forms of governance, electoral system, constitutional court, and citizenship questions to be enshrined in the new constitution. Nepal's economic growth has been adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Growth over the past decade has been below potential, relying largely on remittances and tourism. Nonetheless, Nepal has made good progress both in terms of poverty reduction and improvement of social indicators. The World Bank will support the SRN bridge-related activities, a subset of the overall program of capital investment by Department of Roads (DOR) in Nepal's road and bridge infrastructure. The SRN Bridge Program under the Department of Roads is a subset of the overall program of investment in Nepal's road and bridge infrastructure. The scope of the program under DOR encompasses three primary activities: (i) planning, technical design and quality management of bridges; (ii) major and minor maintenance of existing bridge assets; and (iii) investments in new bridge construction.

More than 70% of the area is mountainous terrain. Road transport is central to economic and social development, accounting for almost 90% of the country's passenger and freight movement. Poor road connectivity is a major constraint for Nepal. Its road density is low-14 km per 100 km2 or 0.9 km per 1,000 people. The so-called strategic road network (SRN), with a total length of about 14,490 km of national and feeder roads, is the core of Nepal's roads system. It carries most of the country's road traffic and provides linkages to major economic centers and neighboring countries. This network consists of three main east-west corridors and several north-south corridors. The east-west corridors includes the EWH (1,024 km). This is the main artery in the country and the one with the heaviest traffic into the Terai region. The East-West corridors also comprise (i) postal roads running in parallel with the EWH along the Indian border to the south; and (ii) the Mid-Hill East-West Corridor (MHC), a series of feeder roads (1,700 km) that link mid-hill districts and the main centers in the hills, including Kathmandu and Pokhara.
Only 6% of the MHC is paved. The government wants to improve the entire 1,700 km stretch into all-weather maintainable standard. This will connect communities and provide access to basic services.

The project outcome will be widened access to social services and economic opportunities. The project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs:(i) rural livelihood improved; (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced; (iii) rural transport infrastructure extended and maintained;  and (iv) project management improved.     

Output 1:  Rural Livelihood Improved 
The project will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. This will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot/mule/link trails, 54 water supply and irrigation schemes, 10 micro-hydropower, 8 rural market places, 10 ropeways, and other community infrastructure.  The project will provide livelihood related skills training to 3,000 beneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60%, are from poor and excluded groups.   In nine pilot districts, the project will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist BGs willing to form themselves into formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives and facilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. 

Output 2:  Capacity and Decentralized Local Governance Enhanced 

The project will improve district and national capacity building to promote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for sustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management of rural infrastructure, and raising central capacity to support local government bodies.  

Output 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained 

The project will improve 260 kilometers (km) of rural roads in the 18 districts (200 km new and 60 km upgrading). Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts and 6,500 meters of trail bridges will be constructed. The implementation of the road sub-projects will employ labor-based equipment-supported methods, and works performed by BGs will be promoted over construction by contractors. Only those civil works that cannot be executed by the communities may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding to contractors.
 Output 4: Project Management Improved 

Technical support to project implementation will be provided through a Central Implementation Support Consultant (CISC) and District Implementation Support Consultant (DISCs) in each of the 18 project districts.

Malnutrition's most devastating impact is on foetal growth, and during the first two years of a child's life. Malnutrition accounts for up to 40% of child deaths each year. Despite healthy levels of economic growth, many of South Asia's countries have persistent and unacceptable levels of malnutrition with complex causality. South Asia has both the highest rates and the largest numbers of malnutrition in the world. Gender inequality and social exclusion are at the heart of the malnutrition problem in South Asia. About 23% (336 million) of the population in South Asia are routinely hungry, without access to enough calories, every day. This is greatly undermining human development and limiting South Asia's productivity with potential GDP loss estimates up to 3%. The funding of this initiative for SAFANSI will be a grant payment to a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank, who will oversee activities to advance MDGs 1c, 4 and 5. The total value of this multi-country initiative is $5.77 million over 3 years, starting 2010-11.",2,2011-05-01,2014-09-30,2011-05-01,2014-09-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,,,,,,110,10,A02,,AUD,,0,0,754000,0,0,0,0

Though pre-project quantification is not possible within a demand driven approach, SGP projects will in particular contribute to: (a) strengthening the Protected Areas (PA) systems of its participating countries in terrestrial as well as marine/freshwater protected areas by catalyzing community-indigenous initiatives that promote the participation and capacity building of local community and indigenous groups in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of efforts to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; mainstreaming biodiversity in production Iandscapes /seascapes by demonstrating improved livelihoods based on sustainable use and harvest; generation, dissemination and uptake of good practices through increased innovation in project design and implementation; (b) promotion of sustainable mobility through non-motorized transport; electricity production from rural renewable energy installations; support growth of interest in Iow-GHG emitting electricity generating technologies; piloting and demonstration of operational approaches to community-based adaptation; (C) improving the performance and sustainability of transboundary institutions (e.g. support for community-based projects to complement PEMSEAâs national and regional initiatives); support IW programme area- foundational/capacity building through demonstration projects that engage local stakeholders on transboundary concerns; support the adoption of local/national reforms by SIDS through water- related demos; (d) dissemination of information on best practices regarding POPs management; promotion of partnerships in demonstration of innovative technologies and practices in POPs reduction; (e) implementation of NGO-led or community-based Sustainable Land Management (SLM) initiatives that apply innovative and best practices in demonstration areas; development of innovative knowledge products that will fill identified knowledge gaps in the Land Degradation (LD) focal area; implementation of interventions that promote cross focal area synergies and integrated ecosystem approaches to SLM; (f) support to enabling activities and cross-cutting capacity building by strengthening civil society participation.The GEF SGP is implemented byUNDP on behalf of the three implementing agencies of the GEF â UNDP, World Bank, and UNEP â and executed by UNOPS. SGP will continue to operate in a highly decentralized and country-driven manner through a National Coordinator (NC) and National Steering Committee (NSC) in each participating country, with support from the UNDP Country Office and in some countries, a National Host Institution (NH I) or host NGO. The UNDP-CPMT and UNOPS will provide, as before, global guidance, coordination, support, and supervision. The UNDP GEF Unit at UNDP Headquarters in New York manages all of its GEF activities, including SGP. The UNDP GEF Executive Coordinator and his/her Deputy are accountable, both to UNDP and to the GEF Secretariat and Council, for all UNDP GEE activities, including SGP. The UNDP Central Programme Management Team (CPMT), located within the UNDP/GEF Unit, is composed of the Global Manager, Deputy Global Manager (Programme), Deputy Global Manager (Operations), Climate Change Programme Officer, Biodiversity Programme Officer, Land Degradation/International Waters/POPs Programme Officer, Knowledge Facilitator, Programme Associate, and Administrative Assistant. The CPMT is responsible for the overall programme, provides operational guidance and support to the country programmes, including identification and establishment of the SGP in new countries, and reports to the GEF Secretariat and Council. Through a global M&E framework and communications strategy, it monitors country programmes and coordinates the documentation and dissemination of lessons learned from the programmeâs community-based experiences. UNOPS following agreed procedures, policy and strategy with the CPMT will continue to be responsible for providing programme management (in financial and administrative areas) and execution support services in the following areas: (1 ) personnel recruitment and contract administration for project staff and consultants; (2) subcontracts for host institutions; (3) monitoring, supervision and authorization of country programme grant allocations and disbursements; (4) budget administration, including authorization and monitoring of expenditures; (5) training and guidance on the above to country-level project staff; and (6) support for initiation of the programme in new countries. The UNDP Country Office (CO) following SGP Operational Guidelines will continue to participate in providing overall management support to operations in each of the SGP country programmes. The UN Resident Representative (or Res. Coordinator) in each Country Office assigns a staff member to serve as the SGP focal point, and the RRIRC or the focal point as his/her delegate participates in the NSC. Each UNDP CO also contributes to monitoring programme activities â usually through broad oversight by the designated focal point as part of NSC responsibilities; facilitates interaction with the host government; and develops links with other in a country financial and technical resources. The CO is also responsible for providing financial and administrative services to the programme, and the Resident Representative signs the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with NGO/CBO grantees, on behalf of UNOPS. The Country Office administers the disbursement of grant payments in accordance with the terms of the MOA and as authorized by UNOPS. It also plays a fundamental role in launching a new SGP programme and in the appointment of National Steering Committee (NSC) members once ratified by the CPMT. As the programme has evolved, the UNDP Country Office is also expected to help develop the links between SGP and the other GEE Implementing Agencies and Executing Agencies at country level. In some countries, the SGP is located in a National Host Institution (âIHI), normally a national non- governmental organization (NGO) or national environment fund. Programme hosting arrangements are normally considered during a new country appraisal mission. UNOPS administers a subcontract for professional services with the host NGO that outlines the technical support and administrative services to be provided and an operating budget. The sub-contract contains rules of collaboration with the host organization as defined in the offer or terms of reference, both of which are integral parts of the subcontract. This contract is supervised by UNOPS. All country programmes, whether based in the UNDP or in a host NGO, equally respond to the SGP Strategic Framework, Operational Guidelines, and other global programme guidance. The following NGOs have been identified as National Host Institutions (NHI) for the 4th Phase - some of which more recently - for the respective countries: Brazil - Instituto Sociedade, PopuIao E Natureza (ISPN), Cook Islands - CIANGO, Dominca - Dominica Saves the Children Fund (hosts SGP COMPACT), Egypt - Arab Office for Youth and Environment (AOYE), India - Cents for Environmental Education (CEE), Indonesia - Yayasan bina Usha Lingkungan (YBUL), Jordan - Jordan Royal Ecological Diving Society (JREDS), Namibia - Namibia Nature Foundation, Tunisia - L'Audit Environnemental (AE), Micronesia - Mcronesia Conservation Trust (MCT), Palau - Palau Conservation Society (PCS), Tonag - Civil Society Forum for Tonga (CSFT), Tuvalu - Tuvalu Association of NGOs (TANGO), Vanuatu - Vanuatu Association of NGOs (VANGO), Zambia - Keepers Zambia Foundation.The National Steering Committee (NSC) is composed of voluntary members from NGOs, academic and scientific institutions, other civil society organizations, the UNDP Country Office, government, and donors in cases of large scale co-financing, with a majority of members coming from the non-governmental sector It provides overall guidance and direction to the country programme, and contributes to developing and implementing strategies for country programme sustainability. The National Coordinator (NC) has the lead responsibility for managing country programme implementation. The NC reports to the CPMT and UNOPS as required. The budget comprises of four main components: A. Grants B. Programme mobilization, strategic guidance and M&E C. Programme management (with two subcomponents) 1. Country-level 2. Global programme-level (HQ) D. Administrative costs /UNOPS Management Fee. It should be noted that the country operating budgets (COB) for each participating SGP country comes from the component A for the Grants and component C.1 . for personnel and country administrative costs.",2,,2014-12-31,2007-06-26,,United Nations Office for Project Services,41AAA,Multilateral,,,,,,,United Nations Office for Project Services,41AAA,Multilateral,NP,Nepal,,679,"South Asia, regional",,41010,Environmental policy and administrative management,100,OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,110,20,C01,5,USD,USD,174737067,0,1606025,0,0,0,0

The project will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. This will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot/mule/link trails, 54 water supply and irrigation schemes, 10 micro-hydropower, 8 rural market places, 10 ropeways, and other community infrastructure.  The project will provide livelihood related skills training to 3,000 beneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60%, are from poor and excluded groups.   In nine pilot districts, the project will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist BGs willing to form themselves into formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives and facilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. 

Output 2:  Capacity and Decentralized Local Governance Enhanced 

The project will improve district and national capacity building to promote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for sustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management of rural infrastructure, and raising central capacity to support local government bodies.  

Output 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained 

The project will improve 260 kilometers (km) of rural roads in the 18 districts (200 km new and 60 km upgrading). Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts and 6,500 meters of trail bridges will be constructed. The implementation of the road sub-projects will employ labor-based equipment-supported methods, and works performed by BGs will be promoted over construction by contractors. Only those civil works that cannot be executed by the communities may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding to contractors.
 Output 4: Project Management Improved 

Technical support to project implementation will be provided through a Central Implementation Support Consultant (CISC) and District Implementation Support Consultant (DISCs) in each of the 18 project districts.

GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVIâs injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets.

The ESP adopted a program cluster approach to phase ADB assistance. Three subprograms were envisioned in accordance with the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 onward. The ESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the Nepal EFA program (2004-2009) for basic and primary education (grades 1-5) with a program loan for $30 million from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of $2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders' capacity in policy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core document. The ESP subprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation and transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1-8 in a few districts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness.
The ESP subprogram III is proposed to support the Government in the implementation of the SSR program from 2009 onward. Subprogram III will cover the period from FY2010 to FY2012, during which the Government will focus on the implementation of basic education restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT).

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVIâs injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets. GAVI's INS support has improved injection safety practices and almost all recipient countries have found ways to replace and sustain the use of AD syringes and safety boxes.

Effective management of school and education is seriously problematic highly centralized and with inadequate local ownership.  Besides many community schools have become hotbeds of corruption with local leaders fighting for the appointment of teachers and resources.  The overall development objective is to attain improved status of education and literacy in project locations through efficient education governance in active engagement of community local government and participation of children. Immediate objectives of the project are enhanced engagement of local governments in education planning and interventions; improved access to school management and quality of education with capacitated accountable and democratic School Management Committees (SMC); and increased engagement of parents community and children in educational planning and implementation.The project will enhance the right to quality education for easily marginalized groups such as dalit and tamang (or janajati) children. Inclusive education is promoted to children with disabilities. These actions contribute also to reduction of inequalities. Majority of the target group children are girls and therefore special attention is paid to consider gender equality in all activities. Climate sustainability is also taken into account in awareness raising campaigns conducted by child clubs.The project has a comprehensive target group who are key actors on changing school and education environment. It includes the 4100 target children and their parents policy makers civil society actors media schoolteachers SMCs Parents Teachers Association (PTA) members and education officials. These groups are reached through different interventions; such as capacity building collaborative consultations with responsible authorities along with wider awareness campaigns and mass mobilizations.

The overall goal of the program supported by this grant is to reduce the malaria burden via effective prevention and treatment of the disease.

There are two components to the project. The first component is rapid results for nutrition initiatives at the ward level. This component will support the entire Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative (RRNI) process. It will start at a Ward Citizen Forum where, invited by the Local Governance and Community (LGCDP) social mobilizer, key nutrition challenges of the community will be discussed. Assisted by a coach at the ward level, the Ward Citizen Forum will select a nutrition relevant goal from a menu of goals. A RRNI team will be formed at the ward level that will set an appropriate and realistic target for meeting the goal and pledge to achieve the goal within a 100-day period by mobilizing the community and finding the best approach to achieving the target in their particular context. Results of the initiatives will be recorded and maintained by Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committee (NFSSCs) and lessons of successful and innovative projects will be disseminated to other communities to ensure maximum learning. The second component is project management, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation. This component will provide support for the implementation of first component under three sub-components: (i) capacity enhancement of the project management team, including cluster units, and NFSSCs, as well as of coaches and social mobilizers.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve living conditions, livelihoods and empowerment among the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste and location. This is to be achieved through: (a) investing in community selected and managed sub-projects that create access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure and services, increase assets, generate employment and expand income-generating opportunities in poor villages; (b) enhancing the capacity of local bodies, particularly the Village Development Committees (VDCs), to provide better services for poor and socially excluded groups; and (c) improving government efforts to better coordinate support targeted towards poor and excluded groups. Given the rapid and successful implementation under the original PAF project, PAF II will maintain the existing design features, activities and inputs, under the following five components: (a) Small-Scale Village and Community Infrastructure, whereby small investments in infrastructure and services can make an important difference to poor communities; (b) Income Generating Sub-projects by which matching grants will be provided to self-selected groups of poor and excluded people for income-generation activities, based on objective criteria including ethnicity, caste, gender and poverty levels; (c) Innovation and Special Programs to continue to support proposals meriting special consideration owing to exceptional needs in a given context, or demonstrating innovative ways to improve livelihoods development and reach targeted groups; (d) Capacity Building which includes five sub-components: (i) Social Mobilization of Community Groups; (ii) Capacity Building for Local Bodies; (iii) Capacity Building for Target Groups Engaged in Income-Generating Activities; (iv) Support to Rural and Community Finance; (v) Information, Monitoring and Evaluation; and (e) Administration of PAF II which will continue to finance the operating costs of the PAF, including staff costs and other operating expenses.",2,2008-12-16,2017-12-31,2008-12-16,2017-12-31,,,,International Development Association,44002,,International Development Association,44002,,POVERTY ALLEVIATION FUND BOARD,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,;;;;;;;;43040;16020;16010,;;;;;;;;Rural development;Employment policy and administrative management;Social/ welfare services,20;20;20;40;25;25;25;25;52;39;9,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,144434200,65051241,0,0,0,0,0

The objective of this component is to make access to technical education more equitable, especially to the poor and disadvantaged groups in the lagging regions of Nepal, and to improve the quality and market relevance of the TSLC and Diploma programs. The third component of the project is supporting short-term vocational training and recognition of prior learning. This component supports short term vocational training and the certification of technical and vocational skills acquired through informal means through both public and private institutions. The fourth component of the project is project management and monitoring and evaluation. The responsibility for carrying out the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) activities under the project will be with the Secretariat. Under this sub-component, the Secretariat will establish mechanisms for overall project reporting and to ensure that timely, sufficient, and reasonably complete and accurate information on project inputs, outputs and outcomes are collected, analyzed and disseminated. The project will also provide support to Ministry of Labor and Transport Management/Department of Labor and Transport Management (MOLT/DOLT) for developing a Labor Market Information System (LMIS).",2,2011-05-26,2015-10-30,2011-05-26,2015-10-30,,,,International Development Association,44002,,International Development Association,44002,,MINISTRY OF EDUCATION,,,NP,Nepal,,,,,;;;;11330;11110,;;;;Vocational training;Education policy and administrative management,33;67;22;78;80;20,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,50000000,6790954,0,0,0,0,0

","One quarter of Nepalâs population lives on less than Â£0.16 per day, and a further 55% lives on less than Â£0.80.  96.2% of Nepalâs workforce is employed in the âinformal sectorâ â primarily smallholder farmers and landless wage labourers - which means that around 11.3 million workers are deprived of access to formal social protection measures, directly impacting on working conditions, wages, and safety nets such as insurance and access to legal, technical and financial services that guard against times of low economic demand and offset hard times. The proposed project fully contributes towards MDG 1b, âAchieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young peopleâ by increasing the capacity of workers in the informal economy to escape from poverty and better manage risks and shocks.  In many of the poorest, most geographically isolated hill and mountain regions of Nepal, residents rely on âself-help groupsâ known as Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) for support. VSLAs help marginalised households to access information, peer support and services, as well as creating group-based savings and loan funds, which can then be used as insurance, working capital for self-employment activities, emergency funds, and savings. An estimated 300,000 of these informal VSLAs exist in Nepal, but they often suffer from poor governance and embezzlement and end up failing to carry out the role for which they were created. As a result, many Nepali people often depend heavily on high-risk informal loans to cover consumption and emergency needs, with many families taking annual loans averaging Â£350 at interest rates exceeding 60% per annum. Many are unable to repay these loans in cash, and therefore often make repayments with crops or take out a second or third loan to repay the first loan, resulting in a cycle of debt from which it is almost impossible to emerge. Facilitating access to formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) for informal VSLAs therefore serves as in important intermediary step that allows vulnerable groups to benefit from formal financial services, technical services, and social protection mechanisms. However, to expand access to such formal SACCOs effectively, qualified intermediary organisations like NEFSCUN must be capable of forming and expanding their networks while at the same time enforcing minimum standards of governance and extending legal protection. Whilst NEFSCUNâs activities have proven effective the organisation has yet to reach some of Nepalâs poorest and most underserved districts due to remoteness and the costliness of operating in these areas. Furthermore, given that their Cooperative Development Process remains costly to implement and is not outreach-based, the reach of their network remains constrained. As such, Mercy Corps and NEFSCUN will partner to develop a cost-effective, outreach-based model to reach the vast array of informal, community-based VSLAs already in existence.

The outcome will be improved readiness of water resources management projects for implementation. The Project s expected outputs are: (i) detailed feasibility studies for high priority water resources projects undertaken; (ii) environmental, social, and technical capacity of the Department of Irrigation (DOI) and the Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP) improved; (iii) Irrigation Master Plan updated;  and (iv) efficient project management.

Given the ADB country strategy and government priorities, the Project will (i) prepare a project for the rehabilitation and expansion of farmer managed irrigation systems, and the rehabilitation and partial management transfer of some agency-managed irrigation systems; (ii) undertake water-induced hazard mapping and prepare a water-induced disaster prevention project for a priority river basin; and, (iii) prepare other high priority projects as identified by DOI. The Project will prepare these projects to a level of detailed feasibility which includes technical study, safeguard screening and plans preparation, and economic and financial analysis of at least 30% of subprojects for project readiness, thereby advancing activities which would normally occupy the first one or two years of implementation.

The Project will enhance the capacities of staff of the DOI and DWIDP through formal and on-the-job training (including participation in project preparation under the Project). Importantly, the Project will reorganize and strengthen the existing Environment Section of DOI as a Social and Environment Section with (i) clear terms of reference of the section, (ii) environmental and social safeguards guidelines developed to ensure safeguard planning and implementation process complies with the national laws, regulations and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement  requirements; and (iii) gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) guidelines on project planning and implementation prepared.

The Project will help update the Irrigation Master Plan with a view to the sustainable development and management of irrigation systems in the country until 2030.  Changes in land use, water use, agricultural technology, irrigation and water resources policy and legislation, and the extent of irrigation development since the Master Plan was prepared will be reviewed.

The project will complement ongoing efforts of the Government of Nepal and civil society to improve water management and the river environment in the Bagmati River Basin (BRB). The project will invest in forming a river basin organization with adequate capacity and decision support systems for integrated water resources management (IWRM). It will finance the construction of upstream water storage, riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, and community initiatives to improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley

The impact will be increased water security in the BRB. The outcome will be improved river health and flood management. The project is the first attempt in Nepal to apply the concept and principles of IWRM since its adoption under the 2005 National Water Plan.

The project focuses on priority issues selected by the basin stakeholders from the basin strategic investment road map. The road map is based on the 2009 Bagmati Action Plan and further consultations with basin stakeholders. The project has five outputs:
(i) Established systems and capacity for integrated and participatory river basin management. Activities include (a) provide legal and institutional strengthening for IWRM and formation of a river basin organization (RBO), (b) mobilize basin stakeholders, (c) build capacity for increasing RBO competence, (d) establish a central water resources information system including a decision support system and an operating water quality monitoring network, and (e) prepare a 15-year participatory integrated river basin master plan.
(ii) Improved riverbank environment in urban areas. Activities include (a) remove contaminated riverbed material; (b) construct weirs and provide phyto-remediation to enhance the river s self-cleaning capacity; (c) stabilize and beautify the riverbank; (d) mobilize, raise awareness, and build capacity of local government and communities for riverbank management and maintenance; and (e) collaborate with the private sector, which has expressed interest in setting up recreational businesses along the riverbanks through public private partnerships or finance maintenance as part of social corporate activities.
(iii) Increased water availability in the basin during the dry season and watershed conservation. Activities include (a) construct an 861,000 cubic meters (m3) Dhap dam and complete detail design of the 8 million m3 Nagmati dam, (b) provide rooftop rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and (c) implement upstream watershed management.
(iv) Functioning flood forecasting and early warning system for the Bagmati River Basin. Activities include (a) upgrade the existing flood forecasting system, 
(b) install a flood early warning system, and (c) increase community awareness and build capacity for flood response.
(v) Efficient project management with effective stakeholder communication. Activities include (a) establish competent project management and project implementation units, (b) undertake timely procurement and disbursement, and (c) implement the project communication strategy and monitoring.
