Nepal s hydro power potential can contribute significantly to economic development, among others enabling the government to provide health, education and other socially inclusive welfare services. Hence, there are clear synergies between energy and the Embassy s other priority thematic areas as well as cross-cutting issues as gender equality and social inclusion. Hydro power development is also important in a regional climate context. Despite the recognition that Nepal depends on private investments to utilize its hydro power potential, national and foreign hydro power developers, including Norwegian companies, are not actively backed by the government and public opinion when it comes to the development of specific projects. This is partly due to institutional capacity issues but also to the fact that foreign investments in the hydro power sector is a sensitive issue.

The NPTF derives its mandate from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and other relevant peace agreements. The NPTF (a) functions as a coordinating body for peace related initiatives, (b) acts as a funding mechanism for The Government of Nepal (GoN) and donor resources, and (c) monitors the peace process. NPTF is Nepal s own mechanism for support to peace building activities. It is managed by the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and GoN is contributing with more than 50 % of the funds. This makes NPTF an important tool to help build Nepalese ownership to the peace process. In spite of the unstable political situation over the last years, including shifting governments, the NPTF has been able to remain relevant and to support important functions in the peace process, for example financing the elections in 2008, the allowances for the Maoist soldiers as well as the maintenance of basic infrastructure in the Maoist cantonments.

To achieve this the Programme will be playing a stronger role in policy dialogue. advocacy and awareness creation. The context is favourable for a total elimination of the most polluting brick production factories in Kathmandu Valley. The outcomes are as follows: - Building materials and construction entrepreneurs adopt environmental friendly technologies and demonstrate a socially responsible behaviour; - Real estate developers and individuals construct their own houses in urban and semi-urban areas using energy efficient building materials and technologies (ownership and marking); and - Government of Nepal (GoN) have a favourable policy environment promoting clean production technologies in the brick sector (i.e. incentives for cleaner production). To ensure sustainability of the programme the required support services will be institutionalized and privatised. In addition alliances with main donors and international as well as local partners will be established.,0,2,0,0,,,,,0,2,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of elected VDC and DDC representatives since 2002 and a weak state have allowed political parties. private sector entrepreneurs and sometimes the administration itself to influence decisions and appropriate resources. SDC proposes to provide a modest budget support to the DDCs in two of its three focus districts: Khotang and Okhaldunga. This budget support will not follow the conventional  modus operandi  by simply putting in funds into the DDC s fund basket. but it will also strengthen the DDCs  technical (mainly planning. monitoring. coordinating) and financial management capacity and accountability. It will assist the DDCs in preparing the periodic and annual district plans that include crucial line agencies and development partners such as SDC. Through this improved coordination. the delivery of services to its citizens. with a focus on the needs of the disadvantaged groups (DAG) is expected to improve. Coupled with the current SDC presence and positioning in these districts. the budget support should allow SDC to increase its leverage and delivery of development outcomes. Moreover. democratic practices are relatively new in Nepal; political parties and armed groups fight over resources and influence at the local level. and most stakeholders including civil society remain divided along party-lines. In such a scenario. the project is also expected to foster a culture of dialogue (and control) among all stakeholders. This should build up experiences and skills that can be used by both the existing local administrations (and the political parties) to prepare for the upcoming transition towards a new federal state. and the new federal unit to possibly build upon. In this sense. the project is also expected to contribute to a smoother transition and prevent conflict. The overall Goal of the entire project is that the DDCs in Khotang and Okhadunga deliver the basic public goods and services as per the aspirations of the citizens and per the provisions of the LSGA 1999 and LGCDP guidelines. The two expected outcomes of the preparation/pilot and the full-fledged phase are that: 1: DDCs have capacity and instruments to manage resources to deliver public goods and services in an inclusive and equitable manner. 2: People. especially the DAGs. have better access to administrative and development services.,1,0,0,2,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,

Ramechhap and Okhaldhunga districts. The initial credit proposal for NSCFP thus covered these three districts. The new Swiss strategy for Nepal (2009-2012) recommended a gradual reduction of its programme from Dolakha district during the period 2009-2012 and the redirection of its development assistance to Khotang district from 2009 onwards. Khotang is one of the poorest districts of Nepal where forests occupy nearly 51% of total land area. Forests play a critical role in the lives of small farmers and land poor by providing subsistence products and income earning opportunities to supplement the livelihoods. There are more than 200 Community Forestry User Groups (CFUGs) in the district who need support for sustainable and productive management of the forest resources. About 50% of the total population are in the economically active age group (14-59 years). This provides ample opportunities to engage them in pro-poor forest based enterprises and productive and sustainable forest management through community forestry. that increases access of people. mainly the Disadvantaged Groups (DAGs). to forest products and generates local employment. This additional credit proposal seeks support for the purpose. The Nepal Swiss Community Forestry Project (NSCFP) has been supporting the forest sector development in Nepal since 1991. The project has made significant contribution to sustainable management of the forests and to the strengthening of decentralised. inclusive and equitable forest governance. especially in the mid-hills. The most recent review of the 5th phase (July 2004   June 2008) has acknowledged the contribution of the project to livelihood improvements of the DAGs by supporting pro-poor and equitable forest governance locally.,0,1,0,0,,,,,1,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last three phases have recorded substantial achievements such as: i) major soil nutrient has increased by 17% between 2003 and 2006 in the fields of farmers having adopted SSM practices; ii) farm productivity increment from 30-50% over the same period; iii) over 200 ELFs were trained and provide services to farmers and; iv) over 60 Agriculture. Forests and Environment Committees were revitalised and received funds from VDCs for FtF approach promotion. The experience and learning of SSMP on FtF are thus acknowledged and incorporated in the National Extension Strategy by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The external review of phase III (2009) has recommended a fourth phase. which should focus on up-scaling of proven SSM technologies and on decentralizing FtF approach to the VDC level. This phase will have two major focuses: i) enhance basket of SSM options and support in adoption of improved SSM practices to seize new production and market opportunities; and ii) institutionalize FtF agricultural extension approach to bring services to smallholders and disadvantaged households. It is expected that by the end of the phase. 50.000 households including additional 34.000 new farmers across seven hill districts of Nepal will directly benefit from the project. In terms of exit strategy. it is likely that in order to fully anchor the system. the programme will require a further last phase of 2-4 years to allow for full decentralisation of the planning. management and implementation of agricultural development at VDC level.,0,1,0,0,,,,,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in the absence of appropriate norms and standards for motorable bridges. it has carried out a few pilot initiatives on motorable bridges. Such experiences have turned out to be over-engineered and expensive. DoLIDAR is thus desirous of a) developing norms and standards appropriate to local roads and b) strengthening its capacities as well as that of the private sector so that these pilots can be replicated. In this regard. GoN has requested SDC to support them with technical assistance. Switzerland has gained significant recognition and visibility in Nepal over the last 4 decades through its engagement in the transport sector. particularly in the trail-bridge and local road sectors. To multiply the benefits to the people. it is time for SDC to embark upon the new sector of motorable bridges. which will not only add value to the existing local roads and trail bridges but also provide opportunities to leverage funds from the GoN (which has committed about $20 million for four years) and other donors. Indeed. to apply labor based approaches in such technology-intensive sector and contribute to improved livelihoods of discriminated and poor groups (DAGs) through skills transfers. construction and maintenance are areas where SDC can make a difference through this programme.,0,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The target groups for LILI include marginalized and small farmers having farming-land below 0.25 hectare. The achievements of LILI Phase I are encouraging. A total of 64 small irrigation schemes. 3 vegetable collection centres and 29 public-buildings are expected to be completed by end of the Phase I. July 2009. The irrigation has been the main component. LILI monitoring report (March 2009) shows that about 88% LILI-supported farmers have diversified/ intensified cropping practices. and thus increased annual agriculture production by 50%. LILI Phase I has also improved knowledge and capacity of DDCs and local institutions/organizations to build and manage farmers-managed small irrigations. As suggested by the Internal Project Review and a Special Study carried out by SDC Coof. the support to public-buildings will discontinue in Phase II in order to be more focused to the small irrigation systems.

The District Development Committees (DDC) and local groups implement the works. with support from the PSU. DoLIDAR is responsible for the Planning. Coordination. Fund flow and Monitoring of the Programme. SDC has inducted many good practices across the rural road projects in Nepal. The green roads concept. that adopts the LEP approach. drawn from Swiss experience. has been adopted nationally. Until recently unheard issues of workers  welfare are now being translated into policy. that include insurance. work safety. equal wage for equal work and facilities that help women to participate. District Transport Master Plans that DRSP pioneered are being used widely. A Gender policy for rural transport infrastructure is shortly expected to be endorsed by GoN. These distinctive qualities helped SDC to upscale its activities through collaborations with other donors. particularly in the ADB funded Decentralised Rural Infrastructure and Livelihoods Project and ADB/DFID/OFID Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project.

The district administrations and the people of the district are the main partners and the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR) under the Ministry of Local Development (MoLD) is the coordinating and monitoring agency. The Project Support Unit (PSU) supports the capacity building in the districts. for implementation of rural infrastructure and community development activities. The District Development Committees (DDC) and local groups implement the works. with support from the PSU. DoLIDAR is responsible for the Planning. Coordination. Fund flow and Monitoring of the Programme. SDC has inducted many good practices across the rural road projects in Nepal. The green roads concept. that adopts the LEP approach. drawn from Swiss experience. has been adopted nationally. Until recently unheard issues of workers  welfare are now being translated into policy. that include insurance. work safety. equal wage for equal work and facilities that help women to participate. District Transport Master Plans that DRSP pioneered are being used widely. A Gender policy for rural transport infrastructure is shortly expected to be endorsed by GoN. These distinctive qualities helped SDC to upscale its activities through collaborations with other donors. particularly in the ADB funded Decentralised Rural Infrastructure and Livelihoods Project and ADB/DFID/OFID Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project. Most of these innovations are expected to form a backbone for the SWAp framework that the government aims to establish by end 2011. While this Phase IV will be the final one in the current set-up.

The target groups for LILI include marginalized and small farmers having farming-land below 0.25 hectare. The achievements of LILI Phase I are encouraging. A total of 64 small irrigation schemes. 3 vegetable collection centres and 29 public-buildings are expected to be completed by end of the Phase I. July 2009. The irrigation has been the main component. LILI monitoring report (March 2009) shows that about 88% LILI-supported farmers have diversified/ intensified cropping practices. and thus increased annual agriculture production by 50%. LILI Phase I has also improved knowledge and capacity of DDCs and local institutions/organizations to build and manage farmers-managed small irrigations. As suggested by the Internal Project Review and a Special Study carried out by SDC Coof. the support to public-buildings will discontinue in Phase II in order to be more focused to the small irrigation systems. Based on good experience made during Phase I. a second phase of four years is proposed.

A one-year preparatory project (103152) saw the formation of research teams in Nepal, Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Tibet, China. During this project, each team will focus one or two issues identified during the preparatory phase. In Nepal, researchers will investigate the causes of malnutrition among shifting cultivators, identify foods that could replace diminishing wild stocks, assess the role of water-borne diseases in malnutrition status, and examine the importance of gender norms and practices in relation to food and water problems. In Tibet, the team will verify the link between the settlement of agro-pastoralists and the spread of infectious diseases, assess environmental effects linked to settlement (including pollution), and solicit support from local policymakers for infrastructure development. The Yunnan team will raise awareness of the importance of pesticide poisoning, and set up a system for reporting, diagnosing and treating cases. They will also explore the reasons why the government-sponsored water improvement program is ineffective and endeavor to improve and embed it at the communal level.

This area has been identified as particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Low rainfall and high temperatures in the winter of 2008-2009 triggered the worst drought ever recorded in the country, drastically exacerbating the national food deficit. Major investment in irrigation systems is considered essential to cope with recurrent droughts. Such investment, however, may not be sufficient, since farmers also rely on base river flows and sediment loads, both of which are affected by changes in vegetative cover, and snow and ice melt rates. There is a major gap in locally relevant scientific knowledge in this regard.This project aims to breach that gap by documenting the specific impacts of changes in weather patterns on agricultural systems, forestry, water and livelihoods along a transect from the Tarai Plains to the high mountain zone. It also seeks to shed light on why some groups are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change than others. Researchers will investigate the critical role that forest, agriculture and water management strategies play in both adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. And, they will identify specific activities to strengthen local community resilience to the impacts of climate change. Their findings are expected to be relevant other regions of the Hindu Kush Himalaya sharing similar challenges.",0,2,0,0,1,,,,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Western democracies, the specter of an Orwellian society has been kept at bay by the enforcement of privacy laws. In Asia, home to the greatest number of Internet and mobile users, privacy protection is at best scant. Global prerogatives around security and terrorism, as well as the claimed need for unfettered access to data to improve business opportunities, have been eroding privacy rights in the region. Indeed, privacy and security are almost always presented as mutually exclusive principles that require trade-offs.Recent thinking on these issues has suggested that privacy could be a means of ensuring greater security for government, and even lead to increased business opportunities. Certainly, the interplay between privacy rights, security concerns and business needs to be better understood. This project will therefore investigate privacy issues brought about by an increasingly networked society and its impact on the interaction between citizen, government and the private sector. It will also provide Asian researchers and advocacy groups with the necessary training and methodology to identify gaps, incompatibilities and deficiencies in national legal regimes with a view to influencing policy aimed at safeguarding privacy and human rights.",0,0,0,2,1,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project builds on a series of experiences with shifting cultivation in India, Nepal and Bhutan that challenge the prevailing view among policymakers and forestry officials that shifting cultivation is unsustainable and destructive to forests and wildlife. The project is based on the hypothesis that shifting cultivation, if improved and rationalized as an agroforestry system, has high potential for poverty alleviation, food security and biodiversity conservation. Researchers will take a pragmatic approach to dealing with the livelihood issues of the cultivators and the health of the ecosystem, and assess the effects of increasing population pressure and market forces.

The additional finance will fill a financing gap that has occurred due to both a change in technical specification (moving from gravel to otta seal, all-season roads) and cost increases from input price rises over the course of project implementation. The modification in specification resulted in a change in the average price per km of US$3,688 while the price of inputs more than doubled between 2005 - 2007 with reinforcement bars and cement increasing by an average of 130 percent. Since the peak, prices have dropped by about 25 percent but remain high. On average, these increases led to a 36 percent cost increase per km during project implementation. On a cost-effectiveness basis the project remained justified since average per capita expenditure remained well under US$1006 and the revised economic rate of return (ERR) is 29 percent.

This component aims to improve equitable access to secondary education by financing: (i) the expansion of physical facilities, including classroom construction and rehabilitation, library and laboratory construction, and the construction of schools for children with special needs (CWSN), and (ii) targeted scholarship schemes for dalits, marginalized groups, disabled, girls and children from poor households. The third component of the project is institutional capacity strengthening. The objective of this component is to improve the capacity of SSRP implementation agencies and its partners to enhance delivery and monitoring of educational services and products. In addition, this component also covers program management costs, excluding government staff salaries, which are incurred as part of program implementation.",,,,,,,1,,,,,,2009-09-22 00:00:00,,,0,0,,,,0.0,,,,,

Communication problems and economic constraints would be addressed in part through the clustering of schools around a resource center which would assume some of the educational responsibilities for teacher training and supervision. Technical assistance would be extended to the Curriulum,Textbook, and Supervision Development Center and other agencies of Ministry of Education and Culture responsible for project planning and implementing the Government's educational policies.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve living conditions, livelihoods and empowerment among the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste and location. This is to be achieved through: (a) investing in community selected and managed sub-projects that create access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure and services, increase assets, generate employment and expand income-generating opportunities in poor villages; (b) enhancing the capacity of local bodies, particularly the Village Development Committees (VDCs), to provide better services for poor and socially excluded groups; and (c) improving government efforts to better coordinate support targeted towards poor and excluded groups. Given the rapid and successful implementation under the original PAF project, PAF II will maintain the existing design features, activities and inputs, under the following five components: (a) Small-Scale Village and Community Infrastructure, whereby small investments in infrastructure and services can make an important difference to poor communities; (b) Income Generating Sub-projects by which matching grants will be provided to self-selected groups of poor and excluded people for income-generation activities, based on objective criteria including ethnicity, caste, gender and poverty levels; (c) Innovation and Special Programs to continue to support proposals meriting special consideration owing to exceptional needs in a given context, or demonstrating innovative ways to improve livelihoods development and reach targeted groups; (d) Capacity Building which includes five sub-components: (i) Social Mobilization of Community Groups; (ii) Capacity Building for Local Bodies; (iii) Capacity Building for Target Groups Engaged in Income-Generating Activities; (iv) Support to Rural and Community Finance; (v) Information, Monitoring and Evaluation; and (e) Administration of PAF II which will continue to finance the operating costs of the PAF, including staff costs and other operating expenses.",,,,1,,,1,,,,,,2007-12-06 00:00:00,,2,0,0,,,,0.0,,,,,

The PRSC program also supports Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving service delivery by assisting the government in developing annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging civil service diversity. It also supports the government's strategy to improve governance by improving the effectiveness of the civil service, strengthening anti-corruption and accountability institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies, and, improving financial management and procurement practices. The improvements in governance that are supported by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable, efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a more favorable investment climate, and lead to better service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in case reforms are reversed, or materially changed.",,,,1,,1,,,,,,,2003-11-18 00:00:00,1,2,0,750,2014-05-01 00:00:00,2043-11-01 00:00:00,,9.3346023560000005E-2,,,,,

The project has the following four components: Component 1) Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS). The largest component is designed to support the VRS in Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) in an effort to reduce their costs and ultimately assist in making them more saleable/privatizable institutions. Component 2) Hiring of Sales Advisors. The hiring of the Sales (Privatization) Advisors will not happen until a year or so into the project when the banks are in a better financial condition and are therefore more viable privatization candidates. These Advisors will undertake proper due diligence, prepare a prospectus for the banks, and then undertake a road show to bring them to the point of sale to 'fit and proper' private sector buyers as rapidly as possible. Component 3) Phase II: On-going Nepal Rastra Bank Re-engineering. The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has commenced a process of re-engineering within the central bank. However, reform, revitalization, and professionalization are complicated, long-term tasks. Greatly enhancing the capacity of NRB to oversee a prudently operated banking system is a prime objective of the series of reforms being undertaken within the sector. Whereas the Phase I reforms in banking supervision have focused on developing an appropriate off-site reporting system and a minimalist amount of on-site bank supervisory assistance, the Phase I1 reforms will assist in augmenting the on-site supervisory capacities to oversee the commercial banks. Component 4) Management Team Support. It is agreed, that the two banks may not be privatized by the time that the current three year term of the existing Management Teams expire (two years with a possible one-year extension).

Samoa is one of the Pacific economies most affected by the gloabl economic crisis. An overall contraction of 5% was experienced in FY2009 (ended 30 June 2009) and, prior to the earthquake and tsunami, a contraction of close to 1% was expected in FY 2010. Formal sector employment fell by 8.1% in the 15months to March 2009. The growth slowdown was already reducing government revenue and constraining the government's expenditure program. The FY2010 budget projected a 5.2% fall in tax revenue, but the actual fall appears to be higher. The expected budget deficit was running at 10% of GDP. Pressure on public servces delivery will add to the stress caused by declining remittances and local employment, and the high cost of living. Women are particularly exposed as they are heavily reliant on the lower paid jobs in manufacturing and tourism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADB launched the Education Sector Program (ESP) cluster in 2006 to support the preparation and implementation of school sector reform (SSR). The ESP adopted a program cluster approach to phase ADB assistance. Three subprograms were envisioned in accordance with the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 onward. The ESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the Nepal EFA program (2004-2009) for basic and primary education (grades 1-5) with a program loan for $30 million from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of $2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders' capacity in policy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core document. The ESP subprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation and transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1-8 in a few districts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will improve the quality of urban life in the capital city of Nepal by delivering growth and addressing climate change and air pollution mitigation. The UTS will be enhanced by focusing on (i) a plan to rationalize and upgrade the existing public transport network, tested through the implementation of pilot routes provided with electric vehicles; (ii) traffic management improve general walkability (general walking conditions); and (iii) improvement of air quality monitoring. The project aims to integrate these components holistically. The environment for development work has greatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has shown that active community participation can insulate development work from a country's wider challenges and thus bring about effective service delivery. Consultations were undertaken with various stakeholders, implementation arrangements have fully taken into account the current political context in Nepal,3 with the implementation expected to proceed amid the ongoing peace process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
