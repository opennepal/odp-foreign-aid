Development of tri-lingual approach in literacy programme provides opportunity to illiterate adults from disadvantaged and linguistic minority groups to learn in their mother tongue (L1), opening their horizon to move towards learning their local dominant language (L2) and to national language( L3).

Thus, it is crucial to have a well-informed population with access to accurate and independent information from diverse sources, with an understanding of what decision-making processes are happening around it, and most importantly with a voice. Although the quality and diversity of media are increasing in more populated areas, this is not true in remote areas. Community media centres (CMCs) and learning centres (CLCs) are important in the fight to support democracy and reduce poverty through different sources of information, particularly in isolated rural areas. A network between such entities could strengthen their impact and role within communities. If these stations are to provide vital communications and learning services, fulfilling the challenge of fostering and developing a transition to democracy building, they must have the appropriate skills and resources and a solid network.   UNESCO Kathmandu will establish again its strong intersectoral character between CI and ED. This activity fulfills the need of promoting and fostering strategies for increasing the use of ICTs in knowledge acquisition and sharing in Nepal, in particular through the CI-led intersectoral platform on Fostering ICT enhanced learning.   Modalities of action:  Building Bridges is an activity which has already been explored during the biennium 2008-2009 and needs to be taken forward in the next biennium. Its aim is to increase the capacity of CMCs in Tansen, Budhanagar, Lumbini and Madonpokhara and create new CMCs in existing Community Radios of Kapilvastu and Janakpur in order to provide opportunities for marginalised communities to be associated with local CLCs and participate jointly and through a sound community network to the ongoing democratic and peace-building process in Nepal.  Modalities of actions include:  1. Strengthen communication capacities of community media and learning centres primarily in rural areas, focusing on skills-building training for CMCs practitioners and CLCs members.  2. Increase operating links among CMCs and CLCs through programmes concerning current peace-building and democracy-related issues. The joint CMC-CLC network will help communities sharing experiences between community multimedia and learning centres, and strategizing means for communication, information, awareness and participation. CLCs will be able to learn about how CMCs can be used creatively and CMCs will learn how to link community media to existing learning centres. CLCs promote learning through grassroots facilities and activities, but often lack of media facilities and multimedia applications to support them. CMCs can combine traditional and new technologies - for example radio and television with internet and CD-ROMs - to enrich and extend the impact of information and communication at the local level using also existing CLCs. This is why capacity building and closer integration among these centres are critical.   Target groups:  Primary target groups of this project are socially marginalized members of the communities in selected districts (Janajatis, Dalits, Women, Limbuwans, Madhesi, and Muslims).","An 8-day training on digital library management was organized for 20 representatives from CMCs and CLCs.

One is weak coordination and lack of necessary communication among relevant line authorities whose inappropriate decisions make it difficult to achieve the objectives of the convention. Site level authorities are not sufficiently able to respond to practical problems in respect to managing the WH sites. This is worse in some cases due to uncertain management under the local trust without sufficient monitoring from a higher government level. There is also no credible mechanism that bridges development plans with conservation approaches.   In this regard, the UNESCO Kathmandu Office will support the State Party in building capacity and cooperation among relevant departments/authorities and site managers by reviewing existing development and conservation management plans, operational processes and monitoring systems, training in institutional and legal aspects of management that deal with WH site, with emphasis on challenges posed by development. The major components of this activity would be as follows:     Operationalizing the Integrated Management Plan developed for Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site: reviving the Coordinative Working Committee, and site-monitoring system as well as integrating disaster risk and tourism management components into the IMP, continuing of appropriate training of site managers alongside municipal officers     Completion of the integrated management plan for the Lumbini World Heritage Site: this includes review of the existing institutional, legal and economic arrangements for necessary amendment and augmentation (leading to revision of the Lumbini Development Trust Act) in parallel with project activities on the site in cooperation with the Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) and the Department of Archaeology; it would include finalization of the Statement of OUV, minor modification of the boundaries which is also linked to the result of archaeological investigation to be funded by JFIT; establishment of a cooperation agreement with the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Nepal regarding the implementation of the Kenzo Tange Master Plan and restructuring and capacity-building of the LDT     Technical assistance to the Nepalese authorities to hold national expert group meetings for natural and cultural heritage sites for the review of WH Convention implementation in the country, particularly as part of the periodic reporting process in the Asia-Pacific Region, and to involve both sides in establishing tentative lists (mixed sites, tentative list for natural sites) and to secure useful exchanges of experience, particularly from the national parks sector   Women's participation will be encouraged within the process. Cooperation with relevant ministries, line authorities and concerned expert national agencies like IUCN will be enhanced to encourage them play their respective roles (advisory, monitoring or consultative or executive as per respective specialization) during planning and implementation of programs/projects within WH boundaries and surroundings. Exchange of experience with World Heritage site managers in the region will be encouraged through effective cooperation with the UNESCO offices in the sub-region and region.","1) Regular monitoring of WHproperties in close cooperation with site management to ensure appropriate implementation of the WHConvention which included:  1.1 Consultation with communities, park management and Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) to address the issues of electricity supply and road access for Madi region between Chitwan National Park (North) separated by Reu River and Indian border (South);  1.2 Briefing of UNESCO's actions to the Minister of Culture, Department of Archaeology (DoA), Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) and Ambassadors of China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand in view of brining coherent action in and around Lumbini;  1.3 Coordination with ADB country office to ensure adequate monitoring of WHproperty during implementation of ADB project; for its project component in Lumbini (whose implementation will start next year), ADB has envisaged to establish a WH Site Management Plan Review Panel consisting of LDT, UNESCO and DoA and agreed to communicate UNESCO on project progress including UNESCO's involvement on its loan review missions, which takes twice a year;  1.4 Required guidance and alert to the concerned authorities on the WH processes and requirements through meetings and information sharing, especially with regard to the State Party's reporting need about any intention or plan to undertake or to authorize in an area protected under the Convention major restorations or new constructions affecting the outstanding universal value of the property;   (2) Preparation and Implementation of Integrated Management Plan (IMP) for World Cultural Heritage properties:  2.1 Kathmandu Valley WH property:  2.1.1 The established management plan has ascertained periodic on-site meetings of Coordinative Working Committee (CWC) among site managers of 7 monument zones under the chair of the DoA that discusses issues and reviews action-plans;  2.1.2 For effective and sustainable implementation of the IMP, close monitoring of issues and improvement in the existing processes including awareness among line ministries/departments through discussions/workshop and integration of components such as tourism and disaster risk management are essential sub-sets, in which our technical assistance shall continue;  2.2 Lumbini World Heritage property:  2.2.1 IMP preparation process started in 2008-2009 had led better understanding of the site status, critical issues and required actions pertaining to site management and conservation, however, pending completion of the plan with necessary frameworks (management structure/coordination mechanism) establishment and its adoption at national level, to which our technical assistance to the state party will be strengthened through JFIT project, a 3-year project (2010-2013) including activities related to archaeological research, conservation of archaeological remains as well as review of Kenzo Tange plan for the Sacred Garden;  2.2.2 Additional appropriation to the regular budget was made to conduct a study on the Sacred Garden in view of supporting the preparation of an Interim Plan for the Sacred Garden. Contract with potential experts/institution will be established;   (3) Capacity building of cultural and natural heritage site managers through:  3.1 Consultation with and sharing of information to relevant ministries and its departments/authorities, on-site direct interaction and status review with site level management;  3.2 Periodic meeting of the recently established World Heritage Site Managers Forum (WHsmF) consisting of site managers from all 4 WH properties to raise awareness about various useful WH processes and implementation requirements;  3.3 Sub-regional Dehradun workshop where 2 national focal points from DNPWC and DoA were trained in preparing the retrospective Statement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV) and periodic reporting for the implementation of the WH Convention in Asia and the Pacific (under WHC support and Kathmandu office close coordination);  3.4 WHsmF next meeting in July will be disseminating outcome of the sub-regional workshop to all site managers and necessary technical assistance will be provided to enable the national focal points to drive the above process;  3.5 A follow-up national workshop in August 2010 (assistance to DoA and DNPWC) to hold further consultations among site authorities (entities: municipalities/trust/village development committee), national focal points and site managers to draft the retrospective Statements of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV: August 2010-January 2011) for all 4 properties and to respond the Periodic Reporting questionnaires (Section I and II: August 2010 - July 2011) as well as to help reporting the progress to the WHC on a regular basis;   (4) Publication/Translation work:  4.1 Translation of Operational Guidelines into Nepali language will be executed upon receiving the amended version after adoption by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th Session in Brasilia;  4.2 Production of an easy to understand comic style information leaflet (in Nepali language targeting literate and illiterate community) on WH properties in Nepal aimed at explaining the value of WH movement and its impact on the day to day life is under discussion with respective site managers;  4.3 As a part of publication series on outcomes and lessons learnt during various WH training workshops (Hampi 2008, Kathmandu 2009, Galle early 2010), the 2nd series on WH Site Managers Experience Sharing Workshop with special focus on Kathmandu Valley World Heritage site is under preparation and publication is foreseen early next year;  4.4 Few publications in plan have to be further discussed with concrete actions for next year;     Progress achieved against the expected results of the activity including challenges/lessons learnt, cost-effectiveness and sustainability as of:   As a result of regular monitoring of the properties, though at a very slow speed than required, reporting about happenings and development/infrastructure projects in plan or on-going in and around the world heritage sites from respective site managements is being done, allowing opportunity to discuss the possible impact and required assistance with the World heritage centre. Due to very limited governmental officials engaged in world heritage related issues, as well as feeble inter-sectoral coordination among governing bodies, weakness of heritage management exists, which is a challenge to ensure timely reporting. More efforts are being invested to aware them of the operational guidelines and processes;     In Kathmandu Valley, the established IMP works as useful tool with increased awareness about World Heritage protection among limited line-miniseries, although needs improvement to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting. In Lumbini, there is increasing understanding of the processes among management staff, but real result awaits the establishment of required management framework, its adoption and implementation;     Increased site managers' awareness and enhanced cooperation through frequent interaction meetings/ consultations aimed at their capacity improvement in World Heritage processes, but national level training workshop is important for wider awareness among decision making levels. Relevant publications production and dissemination is in plan, to aware general public also. There is also need to strengthen executive roles of relevant departments in heritage management areas to ensure operational level coordination and awareness;     Besides above, broader issues impacting upon World Heritage properties such as uncontrolled industrial expansion, pollution, increased poaching in natural sites etc are matters of monitoring beyond present capacity in absence of appropriate arrangement at inter-ministerial level for coordination to ensure efficient reporting and action taking;    Timely drafting of retrospective Statement of Outstanding Value, improved maps in response to retrospective inventory as well as improved national response to the periodic reporting questionnaires is expected after the national workshop and its continued monitoring (August 2010 - July 2011);     Collaborative efforts with relevant departments or partners should be explored given the very limited resources (both human and financial) of the Culture Unit.",Completed,08/01/2010,01/01/2010,08/01/2010," - Bhaktapur (Bhaktapur) - Kapilvastu (Taulihawa) - Kathmandu (Kathmandu) - Lalitpur (Patan)","United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization",Cultural services, ,"RECREATION,CULTURE AND RELIGION", , ,OTHERS - SOCIAL,82016,102534  87238111560,54-12200039-KAT (Culture) Support for strengthening national policies for safeguarding Nepal's intangible cultural heritage in the spirit of 2003 Convention,Support for strengthening national policies for safeguarding Nepal's intangible cultural heritage in the spirit of 2003 Convention,"N°  Performance indicator(s)  (a maximum of three)  Means of verification  (data source) (Optional)  Programmed benchmark  (on basis of baseline data if available (1))      1  Ratification of the Convention  Deposit of Instrument of Ratification   Policy drafted to implement the Convention   Report of the relevant ministry     2003 Convention ratified and policy adopted (Baseline - not ratified)      2  Number of related government departments/ divisions setting up required institutional arrangements for safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in the spirit of the Convention  Operational framework of related departments and their reports        (1) The baseline is to be indicated next to the benchmark in brackets.

Literacy rates vary by ecological regions with the Hills with highest literacy rate (55%) and the Mountains with the lowest (41%). However, the Terai has the highest number of illiterates followed by the Hills. Large disparities exist between male and female literacy rates in all age groups. According to the 2001 census, the literacy rate for six years and older males (66%) is 23 percentage points higher than that for the same age group of females (43%). The youth literacy rate (15 to 24 years) of 70 percent is significantly higher than the adult literacy rate (age 15 years and above) of 48 percent    The weak capacity in the Nepal education sector in general, and in literacy and NFE in particular, have been highlighted in recent studies, discussions, consultations, workshops and reports on education in Nepal. There is general consensus that the capacity of the Ministry of education in general and NFEC in particular is very weak to plan, develop, implement and manage programs aimed at increasing literacy and lifelong education. There is lack of capacity for evidence-based planning and lack of adequate capacity for managing the NFE sub-sector.    Nepal is one of the 20 CapEFA countries in the biennium 2009 - 2011 and is being engaged in the capacity development of Non-formal Education staff and CLC management committee members mainly focusing Education Sector Analysis for NFE sub-sector, identification of potential target group and beneficiaries, setting benchmark and target indicator values, and action planning for operationalization of reviewed NFE policy for achieving target indicator values. The outcomes of this effort resulted in the enhancement of capacity of leadership, ownership and harmonization; institutional capacity; organizational capacity; quality and equity; and knowledge-generation for capacity development in the NFE sub-sector as envisaged in Cap EFA Strategic Framework.  The concrete and tangible outputs that have evolved so far include: (a) National Plan of Action for developing and expanding CLCs, (b) Establishment of NFE-MIS in three pilot districts, (c) Reliable estimates of current literacy skills through literacy survey.    In this context, following a request from the Non formal Education Centre for UNESCO&#39;s support in the NFE sub-sector, it has been agreed that UNESCO will arrange for the continuation of support for capacity development in the implementation of the NFE Sub-sector Programme. As such identification of what key capacities are already developed/existing and what additional capacities are needed in the NFE sub-sector in order to enable the country to be on track with EFA goals by 2015 is crucial. Hence UNESCO Kathmandu aspires to further play an active role in assisting the MoE in the area of Literacy and non-formal education. In collaboration with MOE, UNESCO Bangkok, UNESCO HQ, UIL and other relevant partners, the Office will provide support to the MOE for the development of capacity development plan for literacy and NFE subsector in Nepal.",  Plan for Systematic Capacity Assessment    Capacity assessment report detailing existing and required capacities in the NFE sub-sector in Nepal    Capacity development response for short and medium term    Enhanced knowledge and understanding of capacity assessment and development among Capacity Assessment Team members and others engaged in the processes., ,"Expected Result N°1:   The capacity assessment is undertaken to identify existing capacities in key NFE task areas (the capacity baseline), the on-going capacity gaps and the formulation of a response strategy reinforcing short-to-medium term initiatives for the identified strategic areas of the NFE sub-sector.

Overall, the low priority given for heritage , low capacity at management, monitoring and reporting tasks, lack of strong role by heritage-department, sections within municipalities for coordinating with related line agencies/ministries etc, lack of enforcement and lack of community-partnership heritage initiatives are some of the most challenging part for the implementation of 1972 convention in Nepal.    15. Capacity assessment at all levels and developing strategy for capacity building is a need for long-term management of Nepal&#39;s WH sites.

Describe and define the target groups and final beneficiaries, their needs and constraints and how the action will address these needs    Target groups:  The three main target groups are journalists, local change agents (teachers, lawyers and civil society activists) and government officials.  The 250 journalists to be selected to participate in the training provided by the project come from the areas mostly affected by press freedom violations. These incidents have been, since 2007, most intense in Nepal&#39;s central plains and the eastern hills. Therefore, while journalists in the capital and urban centres have been largely secure, those working in the plains in general and in the eastern hills have been attacked, threatened, or continuously harassed by different interest groups, many of which are also armed. Therefore this project will focus mainly on these areas, where, according to FNJ estimates, there are around 1,500 journalists in the eastern region and around 1,500 to 2,000 journalists in the central plains. These are the areas where working as a journalist is most dangerous, and where the journalists need most support in building their capacity both in investigative journalism and personal safety. Many of these journalists have not had any training in journalism, and do not understand their possibilities and responsibilities in serving the public with accurate, non-partisan information. Therefore through building their capacity, we can improve the access to information for people on district level. The journalists will be selected in cooperation with the local chapters of Federation of Nepali journalists, ensuring equal representation of women, lower castes and other marginalized groups. A special focus will be given to journalists who have already made attempts to practice investigative journalism, but who do not necessarily have the necessary skills yet.  The 250 local mediators (teachers, lawyers and civil society activists, depending on the area) are people who are active in their community and to whom people come to ask for help. These mediators will be trained as local focal points to raise awareness on the RTI Act and its relevance locally as well as for helping local people with their information requests to the government offices. In order to increase the synergies between project components the local mediators will be selected from the same areas as the journalists. That way the journalists and mediators can support each other&#39;s work.  The third target group of the project are government officials who are responsible for the implementation of the Right to Information law. Many government offices have information officers, but in many cases their capacity remains low. By organizing local level orientation sessions for the government information officers the project seeks to build their capacity and to orient them to their public service task. In addition, through linking the trained journalists and mediators to these sessions, the project aims at building local level multi-stakeholder networks that on a local level work jointly to increase and improve people&#39;s access to public information.    The project mainstreams gender throughout all its activities. In addition, the project will ensure women&#39;s equal participation in all training programmes. Individual women will be identified and encouraged to apply, and the trainings will be organized in a manner that suits the time constraints of women.  It is much more challenging for a woman to step up and speak for herself because of the cultural and social norms of gender in Nepal, let alone to demand for information from government officials who often are men. In addition, a woman is likely to be treated differently from a man if she approaches a government office and requests for information. This specific approach will be emphasized in the training of local mediators, so that they will be able to offer locally-relevant solutions - e.g. cooperating with local women&#39;s groups, where the information request does not come from an individual woman but a group of women could help ease the social challenges. In addition, the issue of gender equality and women&#39;s specific needs will be addressed also in the orientation given to government officials.  The gender equality aspect will also be covered in the handbook for journalists and the handbook for local mediators, both to be published in the course of the project. In addition, the project will ensure all promotional products, such as posters or leaflets, go through a gender analysis, ensuring the material is also suitable for women and doesn&#39;t support gender stereotypes.    The overall objective of this action is to improve the transparency of Nepal&#39;s government and the accountability of decision-making through a broader implementation of the Right to Information Act. The action also has three specific objectives: 1) Citizens have access to information that is relevant to them and are hence motivated to exercise their democratic rights; 2) Journalists recognize their role as the watchdogs of the power holders and proactively seek and publish correct and timely information and 3) Local level government officials understand their role as public servants and are more willing to share public information.    Activity group 1: Building the capacity of journalists on investigative journalism / RTI / personal safety  The activities of this group include training of trainers with an international trainer, training of 250 journalists on RTI and safety, a handbook for journalists on RTI and a fellowship programme and competition for best investigative journalism using RTI Law  Output: Journalists have the capacity to use RTI in investigative journalism and to protect themselves while using it.  Result: Journalists are actively using RTI for the purposes of investigative journalism and simultaneously protect their personal safety.    Activity group 2: Raising public awareness on right to information and how to use the RTI Law  The activities of this group include public awareness campaigning, network of local mediators and a handbook and advocacy material for local communities on how to use the RTI Law for obtaining locally relevant information  Output: People have the knowledge of their constitutionally protected right to information and of the importance of the RTI Law to their lives as well as of how to submit requests for information.  Result: People actively utilize the RTI Law by making information requests to relevant public agencies.    Activity group 3: Improving the general climate for the successful implementation of the RTI Law  The activities of this group include local meetings with journalists and government information officers, high-level seminar on the implementation of the RTI act and establishing a loose network of civil society organizations and other potential stakeholders promoting RTI  Output: Power holders understand the possibilities and limitations of the RTI act and their role in its implementation  Result: Journalists, civil society activists and local mediators jointly work towards ensuring open and transparent society where public information is shared freely and without problems.",Journalists have the capacity to use RTI in investigative journalism and to protect themselves while using it.

Transparency is maintained at all stages through various tools like: public hearing/auditing, fact sheets, third party technical audit and participatory decision making process. Only local people are given the opportunity to work on the construction and the maintenance work of trail bridges. Another important aspect is the monitoring to ensure that equal wages are paid for equal work. Efforts are made to ensure that labourers are insured against death and accidents. Formation of an inclusive UC is one of the major tasks to ensure conflict sensitivity. The representation of women in the UCs is aimed at 33% with executive posts provisioned for DAGs in order to help address the needs of the DAG members.      Trail Bridge SWAp Coordination Committee (TBSCC) is established as an apex level body comprising representatives of GoN as well as that of all development partners supporting TB SWAp, to give direction/guidance to the implementation of the TB SWAp. DoLIDAR is the executing agency on behalf of GoN and Trail Bridge Support Unit (TBSU)/Helvetas is the TA provider on behalf of SDC. SDC proposes to continue with Helvetas for this final phase (without going into a tendering process), because of their legacy and leading expertise in this field. Infact, SDC would not foresee a next phase without the involvement of Helvetas.","1200 trail bridges are built and 4000 bridges maintained; 3 mio people have safe-river crossing facility; 3 million person days of employment created at local level; 33% women are represented in User Committees (UCs).
